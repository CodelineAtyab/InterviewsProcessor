[00:00:07.700] Q: Are you surviving? The most important thing — how's your back / how are you doing?
[00:00:09.500] A: Maybe I'm in an advantage; I just want to get done with it — I'm surviving.
Result: Correct

[00:01:37.809] Q: When we show planning poker numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…), given the first two numbers (0 and 1), what would be your logic to generate this sequence?
[00:02:12.392] A: Use two starting variables (A = 0, B = 1). Run a loop for the desired number of terms; compute the next value as A + B, print it, then shift the variables forward (A becomes previous B, B becomes the newly computed value). Repeat until done.
Result: Correct

[00:05:59.435] Q: Given a list like [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 3] and target = 5, what logic would you use to find which two numbers add to 5 (and print them as soon as found)?
[00:07:33.152] A: Scan the list with an index-based loop (for i in range(len(L)-1)), compare each element with the next (L[i] + L[i+1] == target). If they match, print L[i] and L[i+1].
Result: Partially Correct
- Explanation: This finds adjacent pairs (works for the provided examples 2+3 and 4+1) but would miss non-adjacent pairs; a general two-sum requires checking all pairs or using a hash-set/map.

[00:14:50.177] Q: For a high-traffic anonymous feedback app (feedbacks are strings, possibly with username/email), would you store incoming feedbacks in a list or a dictionary — which would you choose and why?
[00:15:57.148] A: Use a dictionary so you can store key-value pairs (e.g., id → feedback, plus username/email), since you are storing structured data rather than only values.
Result: Partially Correct
- Explanation: Using a dictionary keyed by a unique id is reasonable; however, for high-throughput persistent storage a database or append-friendly store is typically appropriate. A list could suffice for simple append-only logs; choice depends on access patterns and persistence needs.

[00:17:21.080] Q: If you store feedbacks in an in-memory dictionary and exit the Python application, then restart it, will the data still be there?
[00:17:32.642] A: No — in-memory dictionary data disappears on exit. You need to persist the data (e.g., save to a file, use volumes when containerizing, or a database) to keep it across restarts.
Result: Correct

[00:22:14.439] Q: Is there a better solution than writing to a file (to avoid corruption on power loss and ensure data is in a correct state)?
[00:22:59.516] A: Use a database (e.g., SQL database) rather than just files; a DB is a server application that provides better durability and ACID-like guarantees.
Result: Correct

[00:25:17.274] Q: What is the difference between a client application and a server application? Is it possible for a server to initiate a request to a client?
[00:25:26.981] A: The client makes requests and the server fulfills them. By nature servers usually respond, but a server can also initiate interactions in hybrid setups (e.g., using webhooks/notifications) — so server-initiated behavior is possible with the right mechanisms.
Result: Partially Correct
- Explanation: Good nuance — typically servers respond, but they can also make outbound requests (or push) via webhooks, sockets, push services, etc.

[00:26:37.978] Q: What is a webhook (how does it differ conceptually from an API)?
[00:26:55.277] A: A webhook is a way to let a server send an HTTP request (a callback) to another service when events happen — it enables the server to notify external systems (e.g., GitHub triggers Docker/CI on repo changes). It's effectively a reverse-style communication compared to the usual client-initiated API call.
Result: Correct

[00:29:37.867] Q: You see the Python idiom if __name__ == "__main__" often — what does it do; when is it true/false (e.g., if you run a.py)?
[00:29:54.621] A: (No clear/complete answer given; discussion moved on.)
Result: Incorrect
- Explanation: There was no substantive answer provided. The correct behavior: __name__ == "__main__" is true when the module is executed as the main program; false when the module is imported.

[00:30:30.773] Q: What is the relationship between an IP address and a port?
[00:30:40.233] A: The IP address identifies a machine/network endpoint; the port identifies a specific service or application on that machine. A server can run multiple applications using different ports.
Result: Correct

[00:31:14.908] Q: What's the difference between public and private networks/IPs?
[00:31:21.503] A: Public addresses are accessible to everyone (on the public Internet); private addresses are not publicly routable (used inside private networks).
Result: Correct

[00:32:42.767] Q: Can a machine have more than one IP address (e.g., multiple interfaces, VMs)?
[00:32:48.226] A: Yes — machines can have multiple IPs (multiple network interfaces, virtual machines/containers appear with separate addresses).
Result: Correct

[00:34:13.772] Q: What is a version control system? Is Git a VCS? What about GitHub?
[00:34:40.519] A: Git is a version control system. GitHub is a cloud hosting/service for Git repositories (stores code remotely).
Result: Partially Correct
- Explanation: The candidate initially conflated Git and GitHub but ultimately identified Git as the VCS and GitHub as cloud hosting — that is correct.

[00:35:17.705] Q: If two team members work on the same branch and both try to push to main, how is the conflict handled?
[00:35:26.174] A: The first push succeeds. The second pusher will get a conflict/error, must git pull to get the latest updates, resolve conflicts locally, then commit and push again.
Result: Correct

[00:36:30.332] Q: In Docker, what's the relationship between Dockerfile, image, and container?
[00:36:48.243] A: A Dockerfile defines how to build an image (blueprint including base OS, language/runtime, dependencies, versions). The image is the built artifact; the container is a running instance of that image.
Result: Correct

[00:37:37.019] Q: Can you run more than one container from the same image, and can they use the same ports?
[00:37:56.278] A: You can run multiple containers from the same image. Containers can have the same internal port, but when publishing to the host you must map to different host ports (host:container port mapping); thus multiple containers can run if host ports differ.
Result: Correct

[00:39:36.603] Q: Do you see any benefit of having a CI/CD pipeline? What is the benefit?
[00:39:39.678] A: Yes — CI/CD automates build, test, and deployment steps, reducing manual work and enabling reliable automated workflows.
Result: Correct

[00:40:08.142] Q: How does a large language model (LLM) differ from an AI agent? What can an AI agent do that an LLM cannot?
[00:40:28.483] A: AI agents can perform actions and repetitive tasks (execute workflows, call APIs, take side effects). An LLM mainly generates text/decisions/instructions but by itself doesn't carry out actions; agents combine LLM reasoning with executors to act.
Result: Correct

[00:40:59.276] Q: (Closing) Should I leave the meeting / stop recording?
[00:41:05.025] A: Yes — stop the recording; save the transcript.
Result: Correct
