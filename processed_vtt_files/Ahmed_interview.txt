[00:01:38.167] Q: What would be your logic to generate this kind of sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) given that you already have 0 and 1?
[00:01:50.796] A: Use a loop: keep two variables (A=0, B=1), generate the next as A+B, then shift (A becomes B, B becomes A+B), and repeat/print until you reach the required count.
Result: Correct

[00:05:59.735] Q: Given a list (e.g. [2,3,4,1,6,1,3]) and a target 5, what is your logic to figure out which two numbers you can add to get 5 and print them as soon as you find them?
[00:08:53.668] A: Scan the list with an index i (for i in range(len(L)-1)), check if L[i] + L[i+1] == target, and when true print L[i] and L[i+1].
Result: Partially Correct
Explanation: The candidate proposes checking adjacent pairs which will find adjacent matching pairs (and does match the given example pairs 2+3 and 4+1), but this approach misses non-adjacent pairs in the general two-sum problem.

[00:14:50.452] Q: If you store incoming feedbacks in a Python dictionary while the app runs and then exit the application and re-run it, will the dictionary data still be there?
[00:17:32.642] A: No — the in-memory dictionary will disappear when the Python process exits; when you rerun the script the data will be gone unless persisted externally.
Result: Correct

[00:15:04.761] Q: For storing many feedback strings (and possibly username/email), would you choose a list or a dictionary and why?
[00:15:57.148] A: Use a dictionary so you can store key–value pairs (e.g., username/email as key and feedback as value); it's more suitable for structured data.
Result: Correct

[00:20:39.368] Q: What can you do to make the feedback data persistent so it is not lost across application restarts? (Better than an in-memory dict)
[00:22:03.214] A: Save to a file (serialize/load on startup) — persist the dictionary to disk and load it when the app starts; alternative is to use proper storage (database) or Docker volumes for containers.
Result: Correct

[00:22:40.218] Q: Is using a database a better solution than plain files for persistence (considering crashes/power outages)?
[00:23:31.384] A: Yes — use a database (SQL or other). A database is a server application that runs separately and will persist and serve data to clients reliably.
Result: Correct

[00:24:24.238] Q: When we talk client vs server, what is the difference? And is it possible for a server to initiate a request to a client?
[00:25:26.981] A: The client sends requests and the server fulfills them. By default servers respond to requests, but servers can also initiate outgoing interactions (e.g., via webhooks) — hybrid behaviors exist.
Result: Partially Correct
Explanation: The candidate initially treats servers only as responders but correctly recognizes that servers can make outgoing requests/notifications (webhooks/other services) though the explanation was a bit inconsistent.

[00:26:36.251] Q: What is a webhook and how is it different from a regular API endpoint?
[00:26:49.405] A: An API endpoint is for clients to request data from a service; a webhook lets a service proactively send (POST) event notifications to another service — effectively a "reverse" API (server-to-server callbacks).
Result: Correct

[00:29:35.355] Q: In Python you often see if __name__ == "__main__": — what does that do, when is it true/false?
[00:30:12.003] A: (No substantive answer given / candidate did not explain; said they recognized it but did not provide the semantics.)
Result: Incorrect

[00:30:30.773] Q: What is the relationship between an IP address and a port? Why do people specify IP:port (e.g., :8080 or :443)?
[00:31:58.307] A: The IP identifies the machine/network endpoint; the port identifies which service/process on that machine. Many applications can run on one IP but use different ports to differentiate services.
Result: Correct

[00:32:06.736] Q: Can multiple applications on the same machine use the same IP and the same port?
[00:32:17.295] A: A machine can have multiple IPs (e.g., multiple NICs or VMs); multiple applications can share an IP but must use different ports — you cannot have two processes listening on the same port on the same IP.
Result: Correct

[00:34:13.772] Q: What is Git vs GitHub; what is a version control system (VCS)?
[00:34:40.519] A: Git is a version control system; GitHub is a hosted/cloud service for storing Git repositories and collaborating (push/pull, remote storage).
Result: Correct

[00:35:17.705] Q: If two team members work on the same branch and both try to push to main, how are conflicts handled?
[00:35:26.174] A: The first push succeeds; the second pusher will see a conflict and needs to git pull to get the latest changes, resolve merge conflicts, then commit and push again.
Result: Correct

[00:36:30.332] Q: In Docker: how do Dockerfile, image, and container relate to each other? Can you run multiple containers from the same image?
[00:36:42.110] A: Dockerfile defines build steps; the image is the built blueprint including dependencies and versions; a container is a running instance based on that image. Yes, you can run multiple containers from the same image.
Result: Correct

[00:37:37.019] Q: Can you run two containers from the same image using the same host port mapping (i.e., hostPort:containerPort identical for both)?
[00:38:16.320] A: You can run multiple containers from the same image, but host ports must be unique; map each container to a different host port (e.g., host:8080 -> container:8888 and host:8081 -> container:8888).
Result: Correct

[00:39:36.603] Q: Do you see any benefit of having a CI/CD pipeline?
[00:39:39.678] A: Yes — CI/CD automates builds/tests/deployments; it automates project workflows so you don't manually run many commands.
Result: Correct

[00:40:08.142] Q: How is a large language model (LLM) different from an AI agent — what can an agent do that an LLM cannot?
[00:40:28.483] A: An AI agent can perform actions (execute repetitive tasks, call APIs, interact with systems) whereas an LLM mainly generates text/instructions; agents can orchestrate and act using tools while LLMs alone don't perform external actions.
Result: Correct

Note: I summarized each detected question by Atyab and Ahmed's corresponding responses. Some small clarifying back-and-forths and prompts (e.g., "Take your time", "Can you write that?") were not treated as formal Q/A.
