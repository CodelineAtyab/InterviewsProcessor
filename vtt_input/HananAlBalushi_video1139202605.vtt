00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.356
Okay, so I have started the recording.

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.441
We'll just start with some

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.487
And just to start with…

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:13.313
Uh, Python B6, then we will move to…

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:13.317
Uh, this bike will be fixed that.

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:15.772
networking, basically.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.109
Um, networking basics, Linux, Git.

00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:21.348
Docker deployment, etc., right? So…

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.984
Okay.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
First, I can directly jump to some, um…

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.726
I can directly jump through some problems.

00:00:27.837 --> 00:00:29.837
intermediate things.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:33.251
intermediate things. I don't have to cover very, very basics.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.255
So I don't have to cover very, very basics, do you mean?

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.829
So, this is the list of numbers, right?

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.218
Uh, I want to find…

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
Uh, I want to find the minimum…

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:44.194
the minimum number from this list, right? What would be your logic for that?

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.361
The minimum number.

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.521
Uh, we're looking for that.

00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:50.727
Just, well, you don't need to write the whole syntax, you can even tell me.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:50.944
This one.

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:55.731
Or if you want to write, you can write it. No need… don't worry about the syntax.

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.019
Okay. If you look right.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:55.915
We'll need to move the new population?

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:59.967
So, one way is to…

00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:59.505
So, one way is to…

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:06.423
We can use a built-in function to sort? Uh, we cannot use built-in. We cannot actually…

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
We can use the built-in function to sort.

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.425
We cannot… cannot talk.

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:09.647
Um, we can first initiate…

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:10.847
Um, we can first initiate it.

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:12.405
assume that the fir…

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:13.992
assume that the first one is the minimum.

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:14.944
Okay.

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:22.086
Then we look through of the list, and we compare with each one. When we find a minimum, we…

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:20.091
Okay, then we loop throughout the list, and we compare with each one.

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:22.563
When we find a minimum, we…

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:29.471
Uh, we will reassign it to the… to the variable. Okay, good. Okay, nice.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:27.196
Uh, we will reassign it to the… to the variable, the new minimum.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920
Until we enter the list.

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.121
Okay, nice. So, for example, you start from here.

00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:33.343
Will you start from here.

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:35.344
You assume that this is the minimum, right?

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:39.746
Then you see this is the minimum, so now 3 becomes the minimum. Then you go forward.

00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:42.773
Um, then 1 becomes the minimum, right?

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.671
James.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:49.285
Okay, so, yep, I think this should work.

00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:56.582
Yeah, sure, sure. Okay, nice. So…

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.183
Let's talk about, uh…

00:01:57.598 --> 00:01:59.598
Let's talk about, uh…

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:02.267
a system, let's say you're designing an application,

00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:02.381
a system that say you're designing an application?

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:05.274
The surveillance management system, right?

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:10.375
Uh, in Python. So you can add students, and you can get their info.

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:10.544
You can get their info.

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:12.908
So…

00:02:11.374 --> 00:02:13.374
So…

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:14.886
You need to…

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.351
You need to…

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:18.787
is stored, uh, 500 students.

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.871
store, uh, 500 students.

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:22.517
Either in a list,

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:22.858
I didn't remember.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:25.095
Auto Dictionary terms.

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:27.315
Right? So…

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:27.587
Right? So…

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:29.296
Which one would you choose, and why?

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:35.238
Uh, I think it's better to use dictionary.

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:35.647
Uh, I think it is better to use dictionary.

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:39.052
It would be easier to access, uh…

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:39.387
Because it will be easier to access, uh…

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
If we, for example, assigned each student a…

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.030
If we, for example, assigned each student a…

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:45.173
For example, uniquely.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.375
For example, unique…

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:50.485
the Kiki or LD, we can access that student with the key.

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:50.808
like, key or RD, we can access that student with the key.

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:52.978
in the dictionary, so to speak.

00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:53.124
in the dictionary, so to speak.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.199
easier.

00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:57.324
easier. Okay, so, for example, if I want to…

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.561
So, for example, if I want to…

00:02:58.256 --> 00:03:00.256
Okay, if I change this scenario here a bit, right?

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.458
Okay, if I change the scenario a little bit, right?

00:03:00.404 --> 00:03:02.404
Like, uh…

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:04.417
Start to play.

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.905
If we change the scenario a bit, right,

00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:11.968
And now the scenario is that you have…

00:03:09.262 --> 00:03:11.262
what the stamp is.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.169
not a student sister… let's say student management system, right? But…

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:17.366
Not a student…

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:22.004
Uh, we are talking about attendance of, uh, let's say, 5…

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.280
We are talking about attendance of, uh, let's say, 5…

00:03:22.404 --> 00:03:24.404
those instruments around the campus, right?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:36.120
And, uh, daily, at 9am, you have to add a lot of attendance records, right? So, in this case, would you like to… and let's say you have two choices. You can keep the attendance records in the lecture,

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:28.228
And, uh, daily at 98, yeah.

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:39.665
And a list. And remember, attendance records have

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:41.876
like, dying, and then…

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:47.866
the idea of the students and certain things, right? So would you keep this information in a list or a dictionary? If…

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:47.485
Do you keep this in functional list automatically?

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.609
If, uh…

00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:53.344
Uh, we have to add a lot of readiness reports to the system. What would you prefer?

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.605
We have to add a lot of awareness, of course. What would you prefer?

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.079
What would be your, uh, preferred data structure?

00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:56.324
What would be your preferred data structure?

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.541
I should choose between these two, right? This or a dictionary.

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:01.645
I should choose between those two, right? List or dictionary?

00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:07.602
Okay.

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:08.102
Okay.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:11.356
So…

00:04:11.764 --> 00:04:13.764
Um…

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.199
Maybe we can do…

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.470
Maybe we can do…

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.487
Um…

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.919
So each student will have different, uh, like, time, name…

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:34.299
So each student will have different, uh, like, just attendance recorder clue. It's actually attendance record.

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:36.881
So, the name and the time.

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.117
So, the name and the time.

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:43.268
Simple, like, for example, the ID status, right, timestamp, for example, right?

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:42.566
I mean, simple, like,

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.187
But, uh, remember you have to insert it very fast.

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:46.487
But, uh, remember you have to insert it very fast.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.052
Right? Which data structure would you prefer, uh, direction you have?

00:04:56.153 --> 00:04:58.153
I think…

00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:58.346
I think…

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.542
Okay, let's say… Yeah.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.189
like, dictionary, maybe a list of…

00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:16.251
like, dictionary, maybe a list of…

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.010
But, uh, if you are inserting super fast,

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:20.595
If you want to start with Superforest.

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:23.967
Right? Don't you think dictionaries are a good idea?

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:24.365
Like, do you think the same is a good idea?

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.221
Or do you think List is a good idea?

00:05:26.203 --> 00:05:28.203
inserting super fast, right? Not…

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:28.554
Inserting someone's treatment.

00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:34.617
Yeah, anything else? Insert option. Do you think dictionaries are good… don't you think dictionary is a good idea?

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.851
We're choosing the community.

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:36.492
Or do you think the list is a good idea?

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:42.485
And maybe in this…

00:05:40.742 --> 00:05:42.742
Or maybe a list?

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:52.119
Maybe, like, what's the reason for the list? Why not dictionary? Because, uh, for example, if we… if we add it to a dictionary, we need…

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:46.546
maybe, like, possibilities and information.

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:52.362
Because, for example, if we… if we add it to a dictionary, we need…

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:54.782
For example, the first find?

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:54.992
For example, to first find…

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.669
Uh, that's key, then assert it, but if it is a list… Yep.

00:05:56.393 --> 00:06:00.393
Uh, that cave and inserted, but if it is a list…

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:02.882
Then you have to search everything, right?

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.250
find from start to end.

00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:09.445
Yeah, third time of dictionary.

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.289
Yeah, what do you think?

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.715
I'm just writing so I don't forget a few things.

00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:21.781
Just relatively…

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:24.833
Okay, so… let's move.

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:25.168
Okay, so let's move.

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:28.882
to, uh, APIs, right?

00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:29.264
to, uh, April, right?

00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:31.087
For example, let's say you have, uh…

00:06:29.337 --> 00:06:31.337
Let's say you have, uh…

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.450
Um…

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:39.814
What is the difference between… or what is the connection between a server application and an API endpoint?

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:40.061
What is the difference… or what is the connection between a firmware application and an API endpoint?

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:44.798
server application and an API.

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:44.803
server application, and… And an API end work.

00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:47.896
Okay. So…

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.266
Okay. So…

00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:54.563
whatever comes into your mind, just concepts.

00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:54.681
Whatever concerns you might as present.

00:06:57.648 --> 00:06:59.648
some of our application?

00:06:57.908 --> 00:06:59.908
Hm.

00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:06.107
Yeah, like, uh, you have a client application and server application. Let's change the question.

00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:05.052
like, uh, you know, right application and etc.

00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:09.671
Let's change the picture. What is the difference between a client application and a self-application?

00:07:06.407 --> 00:07:09.407
What is the difference between a client application and a server application?

00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:15.792
Uh, I would say, you know, it's that server, we, like…

00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:15.471
Uh, what I know is that server, we…

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:17.429
like…

00:07:18.784 --> 00:07:21.784
Clients application, what is with the user?

00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:21.843
Clients application, what is with the user?

00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:23.957
In his laptop.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:27.375
In his laptop. Okay, nice. The server will be on the back, so you take…

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.751
The server will be on the back, we take…

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:29.349
For example, that's out.

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:29.734
For example, that's hours.

00:07:30.347 --> 00:07:32.347
from client to server, or from server to client?

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.746
It can be client-to-server.

00:07:34.842 --> 00:07:36.842
Would you be kind to serve her. And server to client roles.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.419
Okay, let's say… yeah, let's say you have a client and a server, right?

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:42.479
Okay, next time.

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:48.725
Can a server send… can the server initiate the communication?

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:49.032
Get a server for you.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.510
Or, like, or can the client…

00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:52.843
are, like, what can the client?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.180
Initiate the information. Uh…

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:00.509
like, which one do you think is true? The server only responses to that client.

00:07:55.972 --> 00:08:00.972
Like, which one do you think is true? The server only responds to the client.

00:08:01.423 --> 00:08:04.423
Okay, so who initiates the confrontation? Like, for example, yeah.

00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:06.766
Blind, okay. So…

00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:08.845
Okay, so now…

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.100
Okay, so now, let's move to the same question, right?

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:11.144
Let's move to the people position, right? Cool.

00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:15.225
What is the connection between a server application and an API endpoint?

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:14.446
What is the connection between a server application and an API?

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:21.863
So, for example, when the client tries to…

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:22.119
Okay, so, for example, when the client tries to…

00:08:22.496 --> 00:08:24.496
do something, for example.

00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:25.851
do something, for example, log in,

00:08:24.464 --> 00:08:28.464
plug in the API will…

00:08:26.643 --> 00:08:28.643
the… the API will…

00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:30.626
And, for example…

00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:31.002
Uh, for example,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.960
The API endpoint is where the…

00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:33.808
the API endpoint is where…

00:08:33.806 --> 00:08:35.806
the…

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:38.325
The request will reach. Yes.

00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:45.022
It's to the server, for example, until the, for example, there is would be an endpoint for login.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:44.718
to the server, for example, until the, for example, there is would be an endpoint for login.

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:48.339
to this, uh, so the server will go to that.

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:48.557
to this, uh, so the server will go to that.

00:08:49.272 --> 00:08:52.272
Can we have more than one endpoint, or just one

00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:55.864
like, can we have just one endpoint, and…

00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:56.246
Like, again, you have to start at the point, right?

00:08:56.446 --> 00:08:58.446
All of the other things are just internal.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.690
All of the platforms you've gone on.

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:04.175
functions, and many functions, or we can have more than one endpoint. Is it possible to have more than one endpoint?

00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:06.826
On the server, EPA, when I'm dropping food.

00:09:05.048 --> 00:09:07.048
So, for API, for example.

00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:09.931
Yeah, more than one.

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.934
AI endpoint? Yes.

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:11.775
It's possible, or just from?

00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:13.162
Thank you, kiss.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.100
Uh, okay.

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:18.865
Okay. If there are no AP inputs…

00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:18.548
If there are no API endpoints.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.070
Right? Then…

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:22.528
Right? Then…

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:25.846
Let's say there are no API endpoints, right?

00:09:24.107 --> 00:09:26.107
Let's say we had more API endpoints, right?

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:28.829
And do you still want it to serve your application?

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860
Then do you still call it a server application, or…?

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:33.928
There is no…

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:35.239
There is no…

00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:49.115
I think there should be an integral.

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:49.765
I think there should be an endpoint.

00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.951
Okay. Okay, no, no, good. So, environment variables, right?

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:54.139
So, if I haven't…

00:09:53.897 --> 00:09:55.897
Uh, what…

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:00.667
when we talk about, let's say, if its server is there, right? That client is here.

00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:05.314
So, do you see any benefit of having environment variables?

00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:05.541
So, do you see any benefit of having environment variables?

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:07.516
Uh, when it comes to…

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:07.623
When it comes to…

00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:09.378
deploying the application.

00:10:09.983 --> 00:10:11.983
to a 24-7 machine.

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:17.158
And then the environment, variables.

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:16.834
But, um, variables.

00:10:16.912 --> 00:10:18.912
For example,

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.847
For example, today we were having a session, right?

00:10:22.984 --> 00:10:24.984
In which, uh…

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:30.726
Like,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:35.130
Let's say your application, you are developing your application using Windows, right? You want it to work on Windows, but you also want it to work on Linux.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:37.668
How can environment variable help?

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:37.902
How can the environment be able to help?

00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:41.131
Can you come up with an example or a scenario where…

00:10:38.441 --> 00:10:40.441
Can you come up with an example?

00:10:42.052 --> 00:10:46.052
Uh, changing the environments is possible, only because we have environment variables.

00:10:46.314 --> 00:10:48.314
Can you think of such scenario?

00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:56.341
Uh, when did you last use the environment variables, and, like, where do you define it, and what does it do?

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.521
What does they do?

00:10:56.788 --> 00:11:00.788
Actually? Uh, we defined, like, uh…

00:10:58.063 --> 00:11:01.063
Uh, we defined, like, uh…

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:03.847
environment variables, they are…

00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:05.444
environment variables, they are extensively and locating.

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:10.375
This is all time. And, uh, for example,

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.875
And, uh, for example,

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.470
Um…

00:11:12.685 --> 00:11:14.685
Um…

00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.893
Just sitting there doing something. Yeah.

00:11:18.353 --> 00:11:20.353
Just situated at the room for something.

00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:23.675
No, okay, I will give you a scenario, right?

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.992
Notion here.

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:26.709
So, for example, I have 3 applications running on my…

00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:26.887
So, for example, are there three applications running on my…

00:11:27.723 --> 00:11:30.723
system. And let's say you have an environment variable called path.

00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.991
system. And let's say you have an environment where you report fun.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.080
So, can all of these three applic- or maybe let's say you have an environment variable called…

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.570
So, can all of these three appear… or maybe let's say you have a memory available for…

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:38.769
Java is good for me.

00:11:39.188 --> 00:11:42.188
Right? Now, I have 3 applications. One is Python, one is Java.

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:42.376
Now, I have 3 applications. One is Spyton, one is Java.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:48.003
One is Lexus C-sharp application? Can all of these three applications access the Java underscore home variable or not?

00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:46.502
Can all of these three applications at first?

00:11:46.516 --> 00:11:48.516
The job artist for whom variable market.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.709
Duquem? Are you sure?

00:11:53.301 --> 00:12:01.301
What do we… Name is just simply… you know, name can be anything, so Java underscore home, let's say.

00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:57.683
What is the name of the Envitable?

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:01.406
That's it.

00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:07.438
This is the environment variable, right? So I have app1, maybe a Python application, maybe a Java application, maybe a…

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:12.122
a C-sharp application. All are running on Windows, this is set on Windows, right?

00:12:08.464 --> 00:12:12.464
Let's see your application.

00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:15.885
Can all 3 of them access this same variable?

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:15.956
And all three of the types of systems.

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.141
What do you think?

00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:40.874
For example, if they code the environment, they can access.

00:12:38.706 --> 00:12:41.706
For example, if they call it the environment, they can access it.

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:46.953
Yes, like, uh, I mean, they can access, right? No, no, it's good, it's the right answer.

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:45.325
Yes, ma'am.

00:12:47.778 --> 00:12:49.778
Okay, let's go…

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:57.108
What is the benefit of having a virtual ENV? Talking about the Python virtual environment?

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:56.709
What is the benefit of having a virtual EMP? Talking about the micro virtual platform?

00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:06.301
Uh, instead of just simply installing Python and using it for all of our projects, why create a virtual environment first, whatever project?

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.719
And straight up, just simply floating Python and everything.

00:13:02.017 --> 00:13:04.017
Continued for all of forms.

00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:09.356
virtual environment…

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.790
Yeah, virtual environment helps…

00:13:10.108 --> 00:13:14.108
Just to isolate the dependencies of each project, for example.

00:13:10.609 --> 00:13:14.609
To isolate the dependencies of each project. For example,

00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:20.222
One example is, uh, for example, on our project working on a different version.

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:20.646
One example is, uh, for example, one project is working on a different version.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:26.129
So we can easily start in that virtual environment.

00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:30.212
So we can insert that in that virtual environment. Okay, nice. Okay, let's say you have to install the next… I'm quickly jump in because of the time, right? Let's say you have to install Linux,

00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:32.969
Uh, but you already have Windows.

00:13:31.222 --> 00:13:33.222
Uh, if you already have Windows.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.950
Right? How would you do that?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.410
So, we need to have a virtual box.

00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:38.133
So we need… bugs.

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:48.638
Where did, uh, okay, let's say we have… we want to install Ubuntu. Where will Ubuntu come from?

00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:42.655
I need to install, uh, Linux on that virtual.

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.779
use them.

00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:52.574
We will have, um…

00:13:50.807 --> 00:13:52.807
We will have, uh…

00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:57.137
No need to be specific, just…

00:13:55.522 --> 00:13:57.522
needed to be fiscal.

00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:59.107
just, uh, your concepts.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:59.505
Just start it up, one sec.

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:07.879
Is it already available with the VirtualBox, or do we have to download it? Download the… Okay, ISO. ISO, yes.

00:14:03.224 --> 00:14:06.224
No, we need to download the…

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.519
ISO, yeah.

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:12.268
No issues, you don't need to worry about the ISO, right? Like, there's something to download, right?

00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:17.032
When you create… when you create a virtual machine, are you virtualizing the hardware?

00:14:15.178 --> 00:14:17.178
I mean, the article?

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.090
Or, uh, are you virtualizing the operating system?

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:23.721
Actually. Like, is it virtual hardware?

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:25.832
Or is it, like…

00:14:24.616 --> 00:14:26.616
Virtual operating system.

00:14:27.102 --> 00:14:29.102
And what is the difference?

00:14:27.262 --> 00:14:30.262
Then what is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?

00:14:31.128 --> 00:14:33.128
a Docker container and a virtual machine.

00:14:34.327 --> 00:14:37.327
You have two things, right? One is virtualizing hardware.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.999
What is Portugal?

00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:41.505
And the other one is virtualizing the operating system, which one is virtualizing the hardware?

00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:42.023
with Moving partner.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.470
The Docker container, or the virtual machine?

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.258
Docker container window.

00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:56.199
Virtualize the hardware?

00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:01.445
Hmm? What else?

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.290
Uh, virtual…

00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:09.712
Um, the virtual machine?

00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:14.373
machine will, like, on top of your own, for example, laptop,

00:15:10.392 --> 00:15:13.392
will, uh, like, on top of your own…

00:15:13.703 --> 00:15:16.703
on the laptop's operating system?

00:15:14.731 --> 00:15:17.731
operating system would be like that.

00:15:17.173 --> 00:15:19.173
would be, like, another… another one.

00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:25.229
Another end. Another layer, yeah, machine, right? Which has its own hardware, or…?

00:15:19.807 --> 00:15:22.807
Another… another machine.

00:15:26.431 --> 00:15:28.431
no need for the… for its own hardware.

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:28.475
Engage for the… but it's not good.

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:31.624
No need for its own virtual hardware.

00:15:31.587 --> 00:15:33.587
Does it need a virtual network or not?

00:15:34.296 --> 00:15:36.296
virtually.

00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:37.586
Because we specify, like, RAM and, uh…

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:41.535
Yes, that's what I wanted to hear, right? So, which means it virtualizes the hardware.

00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:39.873
This is a great one.

00:15:39.818 --> 00:15:42.818
Which means it virtualizes it.

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:45.179
Right? So Docker containers, they don't virtualize hardware?

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:48.209
Um, not harder.

00:15:48.408 --> 00:15:53.408
Maybe the operating system dependent. Nice, nice, okay.

00:15:48.853 --> 00:15:51.853
Maybe the operating system dependencies.

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:57.266
What is the difference? Like, how Dockerfile…

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:56.756
What is the difference? Like, how?

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:58.957
from poker image.

00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:59.246
Docker image?

00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:03.106
And the Docker containers are connected together, like,

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:02.773
are connected.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:06.915
How do you relate between them? What is the Dockerfile? And…

00:16:07.352 --> 00:16:12.352
how does Dockerfelt relate with Docker image? How does a Docker container relates with the Docker image?

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:12.733
How does a topic container interacts with the domain?

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:14.929
So, the doctor while…

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:18.312
So, the Docker file, it sets the instructions.

00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:17.981
It's a… that's the instructions.

00:16:18.535 --> 00:16:24.535
to build the Docker app. For example, if I run, when we build and run that file,

00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:24.695
to build the Docker image. For example, when we run… when we build, uh, and run that fire,

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:27.949
We will have… the output is the Docker…

00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:28.146
We will have, uh, the output is the Docker image.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.870
Um, which is, like, a blueprint.

00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:33.171
Um, which is, like, a blueprint.

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.592
So the Docker image?

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:38.803
So the Docker image?

00:16:39.283 --> 00:16:45.283
will contain the, like, the dependencies of the operating system, the code and everything.

00:16:39.513 --> 00:16:45.513
I will contain the, like, the dependencies of the operating system, the code, and everything.

00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:50.696
Then you use the container to run that image.

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:48.774
Then you use the container?

00:16:48.727 --> 00:16:50.727
to… to run that.

00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:54.526
to run everything for that image.

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:56.712
to run a battery. Can you run more than one…

00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:59.375
uh… container.

00:17:01.462 --> 00:17:03.462
Uh, and you just have one of each.

00:17:02.052 --> 00:17:04.052
And you just have fun information.

00:17:03.703 --> 00:17:06.703
Or do you need a separate image for a separate container?

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:06.394
Our beauty…

00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:12.391
You mean we can have, uh, one, uh, one image and…

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:12.656
You mean we can have, uh, one, uh, one image and…

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:14.724
different containers?

00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:15.347
Is it, like, one-to-one relationship, like…

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.690
We can run a container-only

00:17:18.247 --> 00:17:20.247
based off of an image, right?

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.130
But, uh, can we run another container?

00:17:21.468 --> 00:17:23.468
But, uh, can we run…

00:17:24.656 --> 00:17:27.656
While the first container is running, based on the same image.

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:30.164
Can we do that? I think, yes.

00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:33.491
I think, yes, we can have multi… multi…

00:17:32.461 --> 00:17:34.461
Containers of the same image.

00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:40.181
Like, for example, you have created your… you have your API, right? You created an image.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.460
Yes.

00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:42.565
So you can do docker run two times.

00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:42.808
So you can do…

00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.141
Broker.

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:47.546
Based on the same… sorry, talker? Yeah, Docker run two times based on the same image.

00:17:45.117 --> 00:17:47.117
Yeah, basically.

00:17:48.195 --> 00:17:50.195
No.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:50.501
No, you're good.

00:17:55.477 --> 00:17:57.477
Let me just write so I don't forget.

00:17:55.814 --> 00:17:57.814
If we just stretched it.

00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:04.471
We can link, for example.

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:05.586
We can link, for example, to containers.

00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:07.057
containers.

00:18:08.474 --> 00:18:11.474
Uh, what is then the purpose of Docker Compose?

00:18:09.286 --> 00:18:11.286
Uh, what is the purpose?

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:15.617
This is the Docker Compose we will run to contain.

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.892
This is a Docker Composer will run to…

00:18:16.087 --> 00:18:19.087
For the same image, or for different images?

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.297
Let's see…

00:18:20.607 --> 00:18:22.607
I have an example, like, uh…

00:18:22.889 --> 00:18:25.889
One is for the… for example, we will have to…

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:32.180
And there's one for the application, or the API, and the other for database.

00:18:26.642 --> 00:18:33.642
I have an example, like, uh, one for the… for example, we have… we will have two containers, one for the…

00:18:32.418 --> 00:18:34.418
So they both flew in the run.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.814
I think, different…

00:18:38.998 --> 00:18:39.998
So, there are different images, right?

00:18:39.011 --> 00:18:41.011
So, invite…

00:18:39.281 --> 00:18:42.281
then why do we even have to care about

00:18:41.257 --> 00:18:43.257
We didn't forget about, like…

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:45.222
Like, why do we even care about Docker?

00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:45.495
Why do we…

00:18:46.424 --> 00:18:49.424
Compose. Currently, we just do everything with Docker.

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:49.048
Uh, composed.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:54.866
Uh, Docker only will run one image.

00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:56.981
One…

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.330
Probably. PS1 content.

00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:00.497
Uh, those are only when

00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:02.831
But I can open a command prompt, and I can also

00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:05.469
again, run the Docker command.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:12.146
And we will have, like, the connection on other networks.

00:19:12.713 --> 00:19:17.713
So, if we use Docker Compose, it will take care of the other…

00:19:18.397 --> 00:19:21.397
things as well, like the connection between them, the…

00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:22.497
I have a… have… have a look at the different…

00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:23.865
Okay. Well, yeah.

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:27.542
But if I run the container separately,

00:19:27.715 --> 00:19:29.715
Using DrawfordRend command.

00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:33.062
Right? And I'm also exposing the products, right?

00:19:33.717 --> 00:19:38.717
So, can one container not talk to another container if we don't have Docker Compose, or can it still talk?

00:19:42.072 --> 00:19:44.072
You will need extra work.

00:19:44.452 --> 00:19:45.452
Mr. Question.

00:20:01.394 --> 00:20:03.394
Okay, sorry, that's more… get…

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:05.559
pitch. Just like I do.

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:09.038
Just like I discussed about Docker, let's talk about Git, right? So…

00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:11.109
So, uh…

00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:13.315
Uh, how… how is the…

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:13.565
How… how is the…

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:19.291
What is a branch in Git, and how is the branch related with the staging area and the commit?

00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:19.436
What is a branch in Kit, and how is the branch related with the staging area dynamic?

00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:23.273
Like, usually, generally, generally speaking?

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.450
I usually generally speaking.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.460
git branch versus staging area versus the git commit.

00:20:23.777 --> 00:20:26.777
If branch persists, staging area versus the contributed.

00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:31.145
like, uh, what are these three things doing together?

00:20:27.838 --> 00:20:29.838
like, uh… what are these teams?

00:20:31.674 --> 00:20:34.674
Uh, do you mean I explained the command?

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.510
It's fresh.

00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:38.768
Just the concept, like, what is a big branch? What is the staging area?

00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:43.861
What is a Git commit? Um, yeah, what relationship do they have together?

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:47.208
So, the branch is, like…

00:20:47.409 --> 00:20:49.409
and isolated.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:55.874
It's the latest place for your, uh, like, for your new chains?

00:20:56.008 --> 00:20:58.008
Let's say for the chains.

00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:02.021
Um, that will not conflict with the main…

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:05.466
We first make the branch to isolate our work.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:08.065
Uh, the staging area?

00:21:08.222 --> 00:21:15.222
are the files that we've… we've… we've… we've done, uh, we've modified, and

00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:17.788
And added to the…

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:21.966
We use different git add, they will become…

00:21:22.576 --> 00:21:26.576
In the staging area. The staging area are the snapshots that will…

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.556
be in the next comment.

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:35.687
a bit confusing, right? Okay, so let's say you have just the main branch, forgot about feature branches, right? Just main branch.

00:21:29.432 --> 00:21:31.432
a bit confusing.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.060
let's say you have to forget about future projects.

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:37.828
In the meantime…

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200
In the main branch,

00:21:38.712 --> 00:21:44.712
You have some files, you make changes to some files, right? When you make changes to those files…

00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:40.936
you at some point.

00:21:42.877 --> 00:21:44.877
When you meet specific requirements.

00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:47.431
Do they automatically?

00:21:45.561 --> 00:21:47.561
Do they automatically go to the staging area?

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.020
Remember, you have initialized a new report.

00:21:48.157 --> 00:21:50.157
Remember, you have to decide…

00:21:50.192 --> 00:21:52.192
You are on the main branch.

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:54.549
Do you put some kind of clear.

00:21:52.772 --> 00:21:54.772
you put some files, right? Make some changes.

00:21:55.675 --> 00:21:58.675
So, do they go to the stitching area automatically, or do they not?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.560
They don't go to the staging area automatically. Technology.

00:22:00.961 --> 00:22:02.961
Don't go to the sea.

00:22:07.138 --> 00:22:09.138
By using Git ads.

00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:09.329
Then how do we make them go to the staging area?

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.100
Nice, right? Okay, now it's clear. It's correct.

00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:15.476
Uh, if I want to… if I do git commit…

00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:15.225
Uh, if I want… if I do Git commit.

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:18.516
Commit will capture war.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.890
Summit will capture work.

00:22:19.954 --> 00:22:22.954
Like, all of the changes, or just the staging area, or both?

00:22:20.195 --> 00:22:23.195
Like, all of the changes are auto…

00:22:23.553 --> 00:22:25.553
The changes in the staging area.

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:25.697
The changes in the state.

00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:30.565
And then, uh, what is the relationship between a commit and a branch?

00:22:26.966 --> 00:22:29.966
And then, uh, what is the…

00:22:32.616 --> 00:22:34.616
Comets and the branch.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.355
The branch will have all the changes.

00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:42.271
of the one stage, not…

00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:44.395
tracked and tracked and all of them.

00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:48.756
And the commit will have the only one that you've, uh…

00:22:50.104 --> 00:22:52.104
Added to the stage change.

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.999
It's a non-permetic associations.

00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:01.704
Never have you ever seen an abruption like this?

00:23:06.867 --> 00:23:08.867
And I'm not sure if you've ever seen. Have you ever seen…

00:23:08.994 --> 00:23:10.994
There's something for…

00:23:10.964 --> 00:23:12.964
Uh, no.

00:23:18.236 --> 00:23:20.236
Uh, let's go to the…

00:23:20.903 --> 00:23:24.903
like, uh, just discuss a few more things. For example…

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:23.309
Like, uh, just, just…

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.402
Thanks, picking up on…

00:23:26.263 --> 00:23:31.263
Uh, what is the… okay, when it comes to deployment, right? Like, what do you think about deployment? What is deployment?

00:23:26.394 --> 00:23:31.394
Uh, what is the… like, what do you think about deployment? What is deployment?

00:23:32.427 --> 00:23:35.427
Deployment is, um…

00:23:33.024 --> 00:23:35.024
Grivalent is, uh…

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.980
making your, uh…

00:23:37.412 --> 00:23:39.412
Like, making your, uh…

00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:41.408
up, uh…

00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:44.542
like, can be accessed by others.

00:23:44.412 --> 00:23:45.412
up, um…

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:50.810
Okay, so… On the production.

00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:49.267
the… production.

00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:53.981
So, moving your application from one machine to another.

00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:57.497
Where it can be accessed, something like that, or something different.

00:23:58.842 --> 00:24:00.842
Yeah.

00:23:58.955 --> 00:24:01.955
Like, in the development machine, you are working on an app, right?

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.140
If I say Hanan, can you please deploy it? So what comes into your mind?

00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:08.162
And deployed means…

00:24:06.494 --> 00:24:08.494
Uh, deployed means…

00:24:19.164 --> 00:24:21.164
remember some things.

00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:24.316
Yes.

00:24:26.043 --> 00:24:29.043
Uh, don't tell the definition, just the concept.

00:24:31.372 --> 00:24:33.372
I guess you would agree.

00:24:31.415 --> 00:24:39.415
Like, yes, you are right, production, like, but for example, if I tell you, Hanan, you have your fast GPA application, can you please deploy it? So, what do I mean by that?

00:24:34.227 --> 00:24:37.227
You have your files to be updated.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.690
What do you mean by that?

00:24:41.618 --> 00:24:43.618
and, like, like, I will…

00:24:44.574 --> 00:24:46.574
make it available in a…

00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:48.554
For example,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300
I'm trying to look for this.

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.896
She's in the dev and also production booth.

00:24:58.187 --> 00:25:00.187
So it also stays in the depth and not the production book.

00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:08.548
I think, no.

00:25:06.763 --> 00:25:08.763
No.

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:12.666
We don't have much, but uh…

00:25:11.035 --> 00:25:13.035
We will have it, but uh…

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.446
There'll be, like, different.

00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:16.547
to be, like, different.

00:25:20.002 --> 00:25:22.002
Let's do…

00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:27.829
Uh, what does CICG do, actually? Like, continuous integration, continuous delivery?

00:25:23.094 --> 00:25:25.094
What does CLC?

00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:30.801
See, I will, uh…

00:25:29.213 --> 00:25:31.213
See, I will, uh…

00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:34.215
tests the change?

00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:34.601
Just the change?

00:25:34.692 --> 00:25:36.692
For example, if we did the…

00:25:35.164 --> 00:25:39.164
For example, if you did the new changes to your, uh…

00:25:37.227 --> 00:25:40.227
you change the other, uh, to your…

00:25:39.094 --> 00:25:41.094
to your project.

00:25:40.404 --> 00:25:43.404
project. It will test the change.

00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:43.211
to attest to change.

00:25:43.543 --> 00:25:45.543
And, uh…

00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:45.935
And, uh…

00:25:47.993 --> 00:25:49.993
Uh, okay, when we…

00:25:47.995 --> 00:25:52.995
Okay, when we… okay, only testing, everything is fine and working.

00:25:50.469 --> 00:25:53.469
Okay, only testing that everything is fine and working.

00:25:54.195 --> 00:25:56.195
And…

00:25:54.647 --> 00:25:56.647
And…

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:58.576
And then…

00:25:56.786 --> 00:25:58.786
7…

00:26:00.818 --> 00:26:02.818
Should I explain music?

00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:06.056
Should I explain using, like, gentlemen? No, no, like, just the idea. What is the idea?

00:26:06.334 --> 00:26:13.334
So, the continuous integration means whenever… Like, okay, let's say CICD, let's say you have CICD, what is the benefit it's giving you?

00:26:06.614 --> 00:26:09.614
The continuous integration means…

00:26:14.216 --> 00:26:20.216
Generally speaking. It will, like, give you, uh, trust that you're, uh…

00:26:15.718 --> 00:26:17.718
It will, like, give you…

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:20.669
trust that you're, uh…

00:26:21.988 --> 00:26:24.988
like, everything is integrated.

00:26:22.002 --> 00:26:24.002
uh… like, everything…

00:26:25.471 --> 00:26:28.471
What is integrated, like, in terms of your application?

00:26:28.735 --> 00:26:33.735
like… like, if you did any change, that changes, uh…

00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:33.961
like… like, if you did any change, that changes, uh…

00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:39.715
It's not affecting…

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:40.061
I mean… I mean, it's not affecting…

00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:41.951
I mean…

00:26:40.306 --> 00:26:42.306
I mean…

00:26:42.464 --> 00:26:51.464
Yeah, your project is working properly. Okay, but even if we don't have CICD, we can make sure our project is working properly by just running the… testing it.

00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:45.646
Yeah, your project is working properly.

00:26:52.215 --> 00:26:54.215
Right, so… why is CDs?

00:26:56.033 --> 00:27:00.033
Okay, let's talk about AI agents, right? What is an AI agent?

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:03.809
An AI agent?

00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:03.977
An AI agent?

00:27:03.978 --> 00:27:05.978
is…

00:27:04.274 --> 00:27:06.274
is…

00:27:08.764 --> 00:27:10.764
Don't worry about this, no issues.

00:27:11.072 --> 00:27:13.072
I'm writing this to tell you later for you.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.100
I'm writing this to… to know what to revise latrines, yeah?

00:27:19.287 --> 00:27:21.287
Just, uh, let me know about the…

00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:25.155
like, how would you define AI agent?

00:27:22.304 --> 00:27:25.304
How do you differently?

00:27:26.592 --> 00:27:30.592
versus LLM, Large Language Model versus AI agent. What is the difference between these two?

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:30.272
versus that.

00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:32.691
Concepts only.

00:27:31.138 --> 00:27:37.138
So, AI agents, maybe when we want to, uh…

00:27:32.741 --> 00:27:35.741
So, AI agents may be where you want.

00:27:39.656 --> 00:27:41.656
to…

00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:41.951
to…

00:27:41.955 --> 00:27:43.955
For example…

00:27:42.227 --> 00:27:44.227
For example,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.330
Customize an AI to do something for you.

00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:51.687
customize an AI to do something for you, like, it's an AI.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:58.720
Yeah, yes, different. That's fine. Yep, we'll do something specific. But an LLM cannot do anything.

00:27:52.262 --> 00:27:54.262
There's something specific.

00:27:59.961 --> 00:28:02.961
So… what can Alan do?

00:28:03.735 --> 00:28:05.735
can just, uh, like, uh…

00:28:03.926 --> 00:28:05.926
And just, uh, let go.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.420
What do you think about… AI agent, okay, yes, it can do something, right? Can LLM not do anything?

00:28:14.087 --> 00:28:18.087
The AI… I think the AI is built on the NMMs.

00:28:14.847 --> 00:28:16.847
The AI… the AI is built on…

00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:20.072
And they use this internet.

00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:22.316
Go to generate? Yes.

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:25.179
Yes. Good, good.

00:28:22.638 --> 00:28:25.638
But can it do something? Like, can it call your API or function?

00:28:26.196 --> 00:28:29.196
No.

00:28:28.238 --> 00:28:32.238
an agent can call, right? Nice. Yeah. Okay, thank you, Anand.

00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:34.121
Okay, thank you.

00:28:33.026 --> 00:28:35.026
Can you please send Padid? I will just save the transcript.
