00:00:02.214 --> 00:00:11.214
The recording is in progress? Okay, uh, Mudar, this is going to be a hopefully quick interview, 20 minutes, right? We are just going to cover a few things, uh…

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.260
hopefully quick in terms of 20 minutes, right?

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.217
Just need to cover a few things, uh…

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.210
Uh, so, uh, we are going to just start with Python Basics, right?

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:15.753
Uh, so, uh, we're going to just start by the basics.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.714
Right? So…

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:18.186
So,

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:21.412
For some people…

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:21.747
For some people, I might skip the basics.

00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:29.073
Okay. Does it mean… like, for example, if you're able to answer some advanced things, automatically basics are fulfilled, right? That will save time.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:28.888
Okay, so it doesn't mean… like, for example, if you're able to ask yourself some advanced things, it automatically basics are in there.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
Uh, let's say…

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.964
Uh, let's see…

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.905
You are…

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:34.373
You are?

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:37.862
developing a contact book application. Contact books, right?

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.265
development, a contact book application.

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:42.087
In which I can add the contacts, I can remove the contacts. Yeah.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.139
In which I can add the contacts, and remove the contacts. Yeah.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420
I can view the contacts, right?

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.725
I can view the contacts right now.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.146
And I can view specific contexts also.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.307
And I can view a specific context.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.146
And…

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:54.157
Let's say you can use…

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:54.374
That's it. You can use…

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:56.556
dictionary, either, to store.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.666
The contracts, or you can use a list.

00:00:56.977 --> 00:00:58.977
That's only the industry.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.924
So, what would you…

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.589
destroy the context, right? So what would you…

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:03.805
So, I'll probably start to…

00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.971
I'll probably start in a dictionary, because you'll have a key and the values inside of it, so…

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.111
Eric, because you have a key and a value.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.004
Maybe you'll save the key as…

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.187
Maybe, you know, you save the key as…

00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:18.488
the name of the person, the first name, and the last name, and then the key is for their phone number, their address, or whatever other things you want in the notation.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.007
the name of the person, the first name and the last name.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:16.928
And then the key is for their phone number, their address, or whatever.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:19.024
other things you want to consider.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.479
Okay, nice. So…

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:22.131
Nice.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.780
what, let's say, uh…

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.810
what, let's say, uh, if I use a list, let's say,

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.982
If I'm using this. Yeah.

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:34.923
to just keep on adding contacts. Uh, what is the problem using a list here? For the list, it won't be…

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.586
What is the problem using this channel?

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.151
For the rest, it won't be…

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.542
organized, and…

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.733
organized, and…

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:42.352
The value is…

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:42.529
you… the link… the value is between the name and

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:47.562
Whatever it's. Inside, I have…

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:52.008
whatever it's… Okay, I have a list of tuples, right? So, I have a list of tuples. So, inside, I have, uh, contact number, common name, right? Then another item would be contact number, common name.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.039
Okay, then another item in the contact number.

00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:54.332
Right, so what is the disadvantage of…

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.619
What is the disadvantage of…

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
using the list, yeah.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:56.894
They're using the list.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.279
I think it's slower than the dictionary in Python. In terms of what, like, searching, it's inside of it.

00:01:57.343 --> 00:02:02.343
I think it's slower than the dictionary in both instances. In terms of what, like, searching, it's inside of the…

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:04.242
Okay, such nice, right?

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:07.117
Okay, so…

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Okay, so…

00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:09.332
If I ask you now that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.750
If I ask you now, then…

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.453
If I tell you there's a benefit of using a list, right?

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.625
If I tell you there's a benefit of using a list, right?

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:17.597
Just like you figured out a disadvantage of Illustrate, there is a disadvantage of

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:17.876
Just like you figure out what to decide not to joking up straight. There's a disadvantage of…

00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:21.648
dictionary also, right? Now, I will give you, um…

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.989
Now, I will give you, uh…

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:27.516
I just want you to tell me that, for example, if I use a dictionary, for example, and

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:27.421
I just want you to tell me that, for example, if I look into a dictionary,

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.509
I want to store…

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:29.912
I got this tool.

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:31.723
a million records. Yeah.

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:31.906
A million networks. Yes.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:35.155
Maybe, let's say I'm reading from a file storing a million records.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.340
Maybe that's meeting from 5 to 20 million records.

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:38.157
I have two programs. One is using a…

00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:38.418
I have two programs, one of these in the…

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:43.483
Technology one is using a list, and I have to add a million records. Which program

00:02:38.568 --> 00:02:40.568
Actually, when you're using a list.

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.002
And I have to… I mean, the first pitch.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
Do you think will work better in this scenario?

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.756
I understand you.

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:49.046
The list one, or the dictionary one?

00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:49.211
This one, or the picture?

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:51.546
I think if you're copying, I think…

00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:52.965
I think if you're copying, I think it would be faster for the list.

00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:56.774
Uh, if you're just talking, okay. Yeah, that's okay. What is the reason for that?

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.974
if you're just talking about… Yeah, we're just copying.

00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:00.283
Because then it's not that good.

00:02:57.507 --> 00:03:03.507
Uh… because it's not, like, two different values for industries, so it just…

00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:03.468
values, or… so it just…

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:08.924
it will automatically… everything in the top of it. Okay, okay, like… But for the initial…

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:09.298
it will automatically just puts everything in a topic, everything in a topic. But for the dictionary…

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:15.101
First of the key, and then the valid key, and then the value. Okay, yeah, I got the idea, nice.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.139
First, the key, and then the valid key, and then the value. Okay, yeah.

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:28.306
Okay, let's move to… you have been, like, working on many Python scripts, right? You might have seen this, uh, if underscore underscore name equal to equal to underscore underscore name, right? Uh, what do you think is the benefit of adding this?

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:21.405
Okay, let's move to, uh… you have been, like, working on many Python scripts, right? You might have seen this, uh…

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:24.783
Right.

00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:26.778
Uh, the painting is still…

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:28.753
benefit of having this, uh…

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
let's say I have a mean.py file. Yeah.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.475
you have filed. Yeah.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500
And then I have secondary.py file.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.708
And then I have secondary work for fun.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.147
And both of these files have this…

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.465
And both of these file apples.

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.005
underscore mean.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:48.209
And then, let's say I'm doing something like printing, or, like, testing something. So what is the reason for having this?

00:03:41.213 --> 00:03:46.213
I'm testing something.

00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:48.537
So what does the reason for having this?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.780
It just makes sure that…

00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:56.011
It just makes sure… makes sure that it's using the same name as the file itself that you're…

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:56.574
using the same name as the point itself that you're working on it.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.039
working on. That's a different one.

00:03:57.324 --> 00:03:59.324
With a different type. Uh…

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:03.667
You have to provide speed on UI.

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.602
If, let's say, you have two files, a.py,

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.122
And B dot PY, right?

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.445
B dot P1, right? Yeah.

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:10.567
And, uh, for example,

00:04:08.754 --> 00:04:10.754
And, uh, for example,

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:13.486
Both of them have this check.

00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:13.972
Both of them have this check.

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:19.086
And under this check,

00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:19.343
And under this track,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:25.205
you know, under this check, let's say I have

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:25.602
you know, under this check, let's say I have…

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:30.232
Uh, I have, let's say, something called ID equal to defined.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.551
ID.

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:33.113
1, 2, 3, right?

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.141
Now, if I import…

00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:36.425
Now, if I import…

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:39.447
we don't pure.

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:39.726
We don't be worth.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:45.125
If I import B2.py, and if I let try to print…

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:45.288
If I import B root BY, and if I, let's say, try to print,

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.667
the…

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:47.946
the…

00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.638
Like, v.it.

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.927
We don't… I need.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.516
Uh, should it work, or should it not work?

00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:54.727
Uh, what are your thoughts on this?

00:04:59.544 --> 00:05:01.544
For this one, I don't think it will work, because…

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:06.628
the name ticked, the name of the file, let's a B file, not the A file.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.802
the name takes… the name of the file itself, the B file, not the A file.

00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:09.228
So when it comes to this function…

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:09.508
So when it runs this function…

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.560
What will happen when I import? So, when I import…

00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:11.847
So, when I import?

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.910
So… What are you in…

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:16.715
So, when you import, you just take the functions themselves.

00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:16.504
take the function… I'm sorry. Okay.

00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:18.902
Uh, but why not this?

00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:19.153
Uh, but I don't just…

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:21.815
Actually, so name is… Name is linked.

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:24.356
So, name is… Name is linked to the file name. Okay, nice.

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:24.126
Pardon me. Okay, nice.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:34.465
Okay, let's talk about, like, I mean, you have seen that we are using VE and Virtual Environment, right, for a lot of projects. What do you think is the benefit of just

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:28.775
Okay, let's talk about, like, honey.

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:34.875
And what it is the benefit of just

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:37.564
Like, because it's simple to just install Python,

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:41.994
Like, was it simple to just install Python in your CDER? But why do we…

00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:42.662
Uh, in your C drive, and start using it. So why do we always…

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:44.725
go for a virtual environment first.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.779
like this, hope for a virtual environment first.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820
Before we start, Bridget.

00:05:45.196 --> 00:05:47.196
should we start a project?

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.805
What do you think is the minimum?

00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:51.816
For our case, or for the normal cases, for the environment, because…

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.930
Generally speaking, let's say generally speaking. Like, if there were security, you can do it for testing

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:56.329
Like, let's say in cybersecurity, you can do it for testing.

00:05:56.331 --> 00:06:05.331
Okay. Okay, you can just open any link you want to, you can open any… Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. Maybe my mistake. Uh, I'm talking about the Python virtual environment.

00:05:57.142 --> 00:06:01.142
you can just open any link you want, you know, you can open any apps.

00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:03.008
In the virtual events today.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.580
Uh, I'm talking about the pipes in which…

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:08.506
On , yeah.

00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:08.787
Oh, you mean the book? Okay, so that's, uh…

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.770
What's the code? Maybe one, uh, one project runs in 3.2.

00:06:09.013 --> 00:06:15.013
what's it called? Deliveries don't overlap with each other. Maybe one project runs in 3 points…

00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:17.223
tool, and the other one is 2.4.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480
two, and the other runs in 3.4.

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:19.833
Some files won't work. Nice, nice.

00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:20.287
some files won't work.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.460
Nice, okay. Uh, I'll quickly jump now. Next.

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.923
Okay, uh, I'll quickly jump up. Next.

00:06:24.232 --> 00:06:28.232
Uh, let's talk about API regional. So, uh…

00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:28.523
Uh, let's talk about API inventory, okay? So, uh…

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.070
I mean, what is the difference between server application and…

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:34.335
I mean, what is the difference between a server application and…

00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:36.358
an API.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.120
endpoint.

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:39.495
Endpoint.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.220
Or how do they relate, actually? Difference, in a sense, like, how do they relate?

00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:50.203
How do they relate? Yeah. Like, the API is an endpoint open for the public to be used.

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:50.418
How do they relate? Like, the API is an endpoint open for the public to be used.

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:53.514
to use certain functions in the output set.

00:06:50.853 --> 00:06:53.853
to use certain functions in the output set.

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.283
Okay, okay. And…

00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.513
And…

00:06:57.248 --> 00:06:59.248
If I say there are two, let's say,

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:59.483
I see there are two, let's say,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.770
the application can either be a client application or server application. Yeah. So, can you have API endpoints in the client application, or…

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.569
technician can evaluate my application or cell application, yeah.

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:07.214
So, can you actually come from the point of tuition power?

00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:09.492
Can you just have API endpoints in the server application?

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.676
Can you just have BPA opt in the certification?

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:14.675
Why not… why not blind?

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.031
It's only in the server location.

00:07:13.043 --> 00:07:15.043
Right now, blank, blank.

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:20.065
Because the client is the one that's asking for the inputs. He's not the one providing them.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.279
Because the, like, the one that…

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:23.611
He's not gonna provide it. Nice, nice. So I'm just trying to intentionally confuse you, right? So…

00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:24.158
But just trying to achieve the superintendent.

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:26.423
Just to make sure you don't memorize the concept strain, right?

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.140
Virtual machines, we've already told a lot about it, right?

00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:35.403
So,

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.729
So,

00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.551
If you want to create a virtual machine,

00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:38.968
If you want to create a virtual machine,

00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:41.086
There's something called hypervisor, right? Yeah.

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:41.335
There's something called hypervisor. Yeah.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.910
So, do you remember anything about Type 1 versus type 2 hypervisors?

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.061
So, do you remember anything about type 1 versus type 1 micrometers?

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.329
How you don't really. Okay, so how… okay.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.610
I don't really know. Okay, so how… okay.

00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:56.182
So, type 2 microphones is actually the… for our conversion purposes, right?

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.330
So, type 2 hypervisors is actually the Oracle Virtual Books, it's type 2 hypervisor.

00:07:56.945 --> 00:07:59.945
So, how can you use Oracle Version books to create a virtual machine?

00:07:57.673 --> 00:07:59.673
So how can you use local coaching books with the need to make sure?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.480
And, uh,

00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.871
And, uh,

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:05.048
let's say I want to run Ubuntu, so…

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.230
let's say I want to run Ubuntu, so…

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:07.417
What are the logical steps in your mind?

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:07.532
What are the logical steps?

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:12.887
Okay. And then, uh…

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:11.382
The logical steps is to firstly download the Oracle virtual machine.

00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:15.273
And then, uh, download the ISO file.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.909
download the ISO file, that's it.

00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:19.634
Can it not just

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:20.019
of the operating system that you want, like Ubunto for this case? And it's not just…

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.930
Why do you need the ISO file? Can you not create a virtual machine without the ISO file?

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:28.066
Because it won't be running on any operating…

00:08:27.154 --> 00:08:30.154
But since we're running on any operating system, it's really running…

00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:30.923
Nice, that's good. Good, okay.

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.886
uh, bashesive scripting, right?

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.178
Um, this is good.

00:08:32.864 --> 00:08:34.864
Yeah, Linux, so…

00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:35.182
Yep, let's slow.

00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:39.993
Uh, on Ubuntu, I can install Python, I can run a Python script, right?

00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:40.378
I can install Python, I can run up Python P.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:45.392
But usually, you will see many people there using BashaScript, right? So, do you think there's a reason for that?

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.550
But usually you will see many people there using measure speed.

00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:45.722
Do you think there's a reason for that?

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.625
Yeah, Bush, you don't…

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:50.165
Yeah, bash talks you directly to the… what's it called?

00:08:49.457 --> 00:08:54.457
To the core of you. Like, or maybe Tesh is already available?

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:52.539
to the core of the CPU.

00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:54.861
Or maybe Bash has already available?

00:08:55.238 --> 00:09:02.238
On Linux, right? Once you download the versions, and download the operating system for Linux, Bash is already installed.

00:08:56.362 --> 00:09:02.362
And that's also, yeah, once you download the brushes, uh, download the operating system for Linux, but it's already installed.

00:09:02.923 --> 00:09:04.923
Okay. And, uh…

00:09:04.675 --> 00:09:08.675
So, Mount Eichen is also true, by the way, please don't…

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:08.519
Okay, so now Python is also, by the way, pre-installed.

00:09:08.826 --> 00:09:13.826
Ubuntu, when you download Ubuntu Desktop,

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:13.733
Sometimes, uh, Ubuntu, when you download to my desktop?

00:09:13.956 --> 00:09:18.956
So, you will see Python will be already installed, so then by Nedbesh screen.

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:18.089
So you keep up to interview.

00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.098
Because the argument was,

00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:28.145
Yeah, but those are the best scripts, you can access the files easily.

00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:26.515
What is the best…

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:31.625
Even easy to access the file from Python also. But for the Python…

00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:34.988
But for the first thing you need to import some libraries sometimes.

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:37.455
Oh, I mean, if you want to just open the fu- yes, okay, let's say…

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:37.818
If you want to just…

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:41.343
We want to make it more simple, you can import something called Globe or other libraries, right?

00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.598
Right.

00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:43.788
But anyways, then…

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.760
still, everyone knows Python.

00:09:45.058 --> 00:09:47.058
Still key. Everyone goes by, right? Yeah.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.210
Only a few people, they have hands-on experience in Bachelor scripting. Still, they do use Basher scripting.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.350
Only a few people…

00:09:50.497 --> 00:09:52.497
still didn't do special something.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.717
they intentionally avoid Python.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.990
they can see a white collection.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.886
Do you see any other reason besides…

00:09:55.976 --> 00:09:59.976
is faster, as I think.

00:09:59.073 --> 00:10:01.073
It's supposed to…

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:04.349
Especially on both and running the bash script itself.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.020
running the, uh, the bus script.

00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.588
What if I tell you that, uh…

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.868
What if I tell you that, uh…

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:11.006
Python script, if it's a very… if it's doing something very simple.

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:11.174
you're pressuring something, but it's…

00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:17.671
Orbacious Script is also doing something very simple, right? We are not talking about complex applications. Performance is negligible when we talk about

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:15.855
We're not talking about objects and things.

00:10:16.054 --> 00:10:18.054
When we talk about…

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:20.054
Yeah, propagation, right?

00:10:18.262 --> 00:10:23.262
Simple applications, right? So, anything else coming into your mind? Like, why would people go for…

00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:22.633
So, anything else coming to mind? Goodbye.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:26.664
In terms of deployment goes…

00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:26.474
In terms of deployment, okay, let's say because

00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:31.482
People are using, uh, Ubuntu to actually their applications, and…

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.890
Because in their applications anyway.

00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:34.484
I mean, uh…

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:34.683
I mean, uh…

00:10:34.847 --> 00:10:38.847
based on that information, uh, of course, believe…

00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:39.273
based on that information. Of course, the new

00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:42.986
Ubuntu or something, uh, still, is there a reason?

00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:43.158
Ubuntu OS comes with Python, but still is there a reason.

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:50.863
To avoid Python, for startups and certain tasks, and just measured scripting, is there a benefit in terms of, like, deployment, or…

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:51.245
Because a white person is startups, and by specific is that they are a benefit in terms of, like, deployment or…

00:10:51.854 --> 00:10:53.854
When you're trying to learn about Linux?

00:10:53.908 --> 00:10:55.908
I don't have to deploy anything.

00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.209
I'm trying to deploy anything.

00:10:57.137 --> 00:11:00.137
you probably won't use a virtual machine, sometimes you'll use, like, the WSL.

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:03.045
So, let's say something else.

00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:03.528
So in the WSL, you'll use the same scripting as the bush scripting.

00:11:04.013 --> 00:11:07.013
Okay, maybe I will try to explain one more time again, right? For example,

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:07.169
Okay. For example,

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:13.238
So, if I am using Bash's scriptkin, for example, for something,

00:11:09.666 --> 00:11:13.666
So, if… Here's something…

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:17.615
Can this measure script run on any…

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.740
get dismissed the bloody.

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:22.948
version of Ubuntu. Yeah, because it's all the same. So, uh, Python…

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.280
Yeah, because it's all the same, you know, PyCon?

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:25.882
these structuring Python and Ubuntu Desktop.

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.066
Do you start shipping Python over to desktop?

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:29.626
Yeah.

00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:32.904
Yeah, not that long time ago, right? Recently, right? So, now, do you see the benefit of… This is a budget for, like,

00:11:29.907 --> 00:11:33.907
So, now, do you see any benefit of a… So the best one, like, bushes…

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:39.150
coding is supported by the conceivable. Yes, right? So, for example, so…

00:11:34.596 --> 00:11:39.596
Cody is supported by different versions, even older ones. Yes, right? So, for example…

00:11:39.154 --> 00:11:44.154
So you can use Bishop… can you use, then, bashes called Python? Like, if it's not available or not?

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:44.598
So you can use special… can you use the special script to install Python? Like, that's not available or not?

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:49.329
If Bash isn't available? Yeah, go for it.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.480
if most isn't… let's say Besh is available, of course, right? Can you use a Bash script to install Python if Python is not available?

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:54.168
Can you use a bench script installed Pythonif, Python is front of it. Yeah, you can do that.

00:11:53.153 --> 00:11:59.153
You can do it, right? And if Python is available, just skip and move on to the next step. This is what people do, actually.

00:11:55.476 --> 00:11:59.476
And if I just quickly skip and move on to the next step, this is what people do, actually. Yeah.

00:11:59.703 --> 00:12:03.703
Yeah, right away, nice. But nice, I was not able to explain the question very well.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.290
Very nice.

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:12.055
Uh, simple thing, right? Let's move to Git. Uh, what is the difference between, like, a staging area…

00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:08.287
Uh, simple thing, right? Let's move to Git.

00:12:08.907 --> 00:12:11.907
Uh, what is the difference between, like, a staging area,

00:12:12.322 --> 00:12:15.322
branch, staging area,

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:15.516
of the trash?

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.652
and commit. How are these things related?

00:12:15.873 --> 00:12:18.873
How are these things related?

00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:22.015
So, the circle… uh…

00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:21.336
So, at the start, when you create a branch,

00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:28.456
Git will not follow the files. It will know that there will be… there have been changes, but it won't save them.

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:28.596
it will not follow the plates. It will know that there will be… there have been changes, but it won't seal them. Yeah.

00:12:28.924 --> 00:12:34.924
So once you add them to the staging area, it will know what have been changed, and it will follow the changes.

00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:34.584
So once you add them to the staging area, it will know what have you changed, and it will follow the changes.

00:12:35.099 --> 00:12:40.099
Okay, nice. And once you commit to the changes, you just… it's… commit is like the same checkpoint.

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:39.454
And once you commit the changes, you just… it's… commit is, like, safe.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.760
The checkpoint. India, like, you're…

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:45.429
Where does the commit go in the staging area, in the branch, in your, like, your…

00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:51.048
Google Drive SSD, and we're… this is the commit is stored, actually? It's a network, and…

00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:51.481
local product system. It's a neutrical…

00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:53.534
Not branch-free.

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:53.575
fights.

00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:56.371
No. Okay. So, uh…

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:56.523
No. So, uh…

00:12:56.873 --> 00:13:02.873
Let's say GitHub, right? Yeah. Let's say you want to… like, why would you use GitHub?

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:03.150
Unless you, like… let's say you want to do… like, why would you use guitar?

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:06.569
Can you… can you track all of your files and…

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.890
Can you… can you try all of your files and…

00:13:06.757 --> 00:13:08.757
Can you just…

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.112
Uh, can you just…

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:13.434
perform commits, create new launches without GitHub? Yeah, you can do that. Then why GitHub.

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:15.519
perform coverage without crypto? Yeah, you can do that. It's to be possible.

00:13:13.382 --> 00:13:15.382
It's be important.

00:13:16.223 --> 00:13:21.223
You can use it in different devices if you want, and you can share it with your colleagues or your friends.

00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:23.466
You can use it, but if you want, you can share it with your colleagues or friends for multiple conversations.

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:23.909
or multiple people to work on the same projects.

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:26.583
Okay, nice. So…

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:28.493
So, yep, so…

00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:29.073
Yep, so… okay. Anyways…

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.559
News.

00:13:32.155 --> 00:13:36.155
let's go forward. Let's talk about some Docker basics, right?

00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:36.413
Let's move forward. The Starbucks and docket V6, right?

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:38.994
Just like I asked you about

00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:39.147
Just like I asked you about…

00:13:39.612 --> 00:13:41.612
the staging area commit and branch.

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.952
the staging area committed and branded.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.363
Let's talk about Dockerfile image versus container.

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:44.514
But some of our broker file image was sentient.

00:13:44.973 --> 00:13:48.973
So, how are they related? How is Dockerfile related to image and Docker container?

00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:49.112
So, how are they supposed to offer foreign privilege to image in the document?

00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:51.366
So, once you hover up.

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:52.013
So, once you have your app finished…

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:57.319
it'll directly look quite closely. We make a Docker image, the Docker image is, like, a snapshot of the…

00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:57.445
to make a Docker image. The Docker image is, like, a snapshot of the…

00:13:57.688 --> 00:13:59.688
If the app, it says, and…

00:13:57.804 --> 00:13:59.804
for the app itself, and…

00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.041
And it's a step-by-step on how the app would work.

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:03.279
And it's a step-by-step on how the app will work.

00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:08.564
And to run the Docker image itself, you have to put it inside a container.

00:14:04.908 --> 00:14:08.908
And to run the Docker image itself, you have to put it inside a container.

00:14:08.872 --> 00:14:14.872
then, like, run it or pause it whenever… Can I done… can I run more than one container using the same image?

00:14:09.017 --> 00:14:14.017
You can, like, run it or pause it whenever… can I run more than one container?

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:17.109
Yeah, you can do that. At the same time.

00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:17.448
Yeah, you can do that. At the same time. Yes.

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:20.924
Okay, nice. So let's do…

00:14:22.264 --> 00:14:24.264
Let's go to… okay, you also know about, like,

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:24.449
You also know about, like,

00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:26.747
Recently, we were discussing about volumes, right?

00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:31.061
Like, uh, what do you think about… let's forget volumes first. Docker Compose.

00:14:28.449 --> 00:14:31.449
Talk to Compose.

00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:37.923
uh, like, why would we want to use Docker Compose when you can do everything without Docker Compose?

00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:35.127
Uh, like, why don't use Stoker.

00:14:39.523 --> 00:14:44.523
It's for it to be able to be built in different operating systems, so it can work in both.

00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:41.891
It's hard to be rebuilt.

00:14:42.286 --> 00:14:44.286
different, different than working.

00:14:44.862 --> 00:14:47.862
clinics, vendors, prior… Do you think we can just…

00:14:45.193 --> 00:14:48.193
Linux, Windows, or IOST. Do you think we can just…

00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:51.051
not just use Docker? Sometimes…

00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:51.859
Sometimes it won't work, you know.

00:14:53.072 --> 00:14:57.072
Okay. I will not tell you, the later I will tell you the normal. Okay.

00:14:53.194 --> 00:15:01.194
Okay, yeah. I will not tell you… later I will tell you the wrong right and whatever or not, right? So I'll just skip, and there's a miscondri.

00:14:57.609 --> 00:15:00.609
Right? So I'm just skip it.

00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:07.734
manual deployment, right? Let's talk about deployment. So…

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:07.889
So, diploma, so…

00:15:09.495 --> 00:15:16.495
When we say this word deployment, what comes in your mind? Like, you have your application running here, right? And if I tell you, Mutar, can you please deploy it?

00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:16.677
What comes in your mind? Like, you have your application running here, right? And if I tell bother, can you please deploy the Zoom?

00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:19.098
what comes in your mind? It's either…

00:15:17.352 --> 00:15:19.352
It's either…

00:15:19.487 --> 00:15:22.487
it has to be hosted. It will be running…

00:15:20.073 --> 00:15:24.073
it has to be hosted somewhere else that will be running 24-7.

00:15:23.605 --> 00:15:27.605
Of course, and publicly accessories, mostly, like, maybe not…

00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:28.005
Or whatever…

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:29.825
Definitely want to apologize.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.190
People really want to have to have access.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.800
So, uh…

00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:32.193
So, uh…

00:15:32.005 --> 00:15:34.005
Then, what is the benefit of CICD?

00:15:32.325 --> 00:15:34.325
What is the benefit of CIE be?

00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.121
like, for example, uh…

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.520
like, for example, uh…

00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:39.851
Okay, uh…

00:15:38.153 --> 00:15:40.153
Okay, alright.

00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:44.048
How… how would you manually deploy your first DPA application first?

00:15:41.266 --> 00:15:44.266
How… how do you manually deploy your first API engineers?

00:15:45.464 --> 00:15:47.464
let's say, do we…

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.583
let's say… do we…

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.148
is… is using Docker a must?

00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:51.451
is using Docker a must, but can you also…

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:54.079
Or can you also deploy the application without using Docker? You can deploy Docker.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.493
Whether we keep buildings in court. You can deploy it without using Docker, but it…

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:59.389
You know, having a Docker image, it's easier and dock. Okay, nice.

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:59.245
having a Docker image, it makes it easier and faster.

00:15:59.464 --> 00:16:08.464
So, then, okay, let's move forward, and we automate this deployment, right? So, what is the benefit of automating the deployments using CICD?

00:15:59.994 --> 00:16:04.994
So, then, okay, let's move forward, and we automate this deployment, right?

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.798
So, what is the benefit of automating the deployments in Scales?

00:16:08.907 --> 00:16:12.907
So that whenever you make any changes or have any updates or any versions…

00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:13.058
May I have 20%?

00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:19.247
you just upload it to the, let's say it's in GitHub. Once it's uploaded in GitHub, CDCD pipeline.

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:19.589
you just upload it to, let's say, from GitHub. Once you upload it in GitHub, the CDCD pipeline.

00:16:19.507 --> 00:16:23.507
will automatically take the latest version, make it, like, to the current image.

00:16:20.385 --> 00:16:26.385
will automatically take the updated version, make it like a Docker image to the container, and updates it.

00:16:24.197 --> 00:16:26.197
to the container and updates it.

00:16:26.265 --> 00:16:29.265
Well, that's separate, uh, running back to me.

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:29.439
Well, the app itself is, uh, running, and…

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:33.927
it won't stop from people losing.

00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:36.012
won't stop… So, kind of saving your time is the benefit of that. Okay, nice. One last thing.

00:16:34.414 --> 00:16:36.414
And I swear one last thing.

00:16:37.658 --> 00:16:39.658
Uh, let's say you have, uh, 6…

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.880
let's say you have, uh, suits…

00:16:40.122 --> 00:16:43.122
3… maybe 2, 1…

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:45.609
7, 8, right?

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:46.586
7, 8, right? Yeah.

00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:49.744
I want to…

00:16:50.682 --> 00:16:55.682
I want to write an algorithm which can actually shift all of the even numbers on the left-hand side and odd numbers on the right-hand side.

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.359
Uh, just your logic, right? No need to…

00:16:56.619 --> 00:17:01.619
If you want, you can.

00:16:58.835 --> 00:17:05.835
Yeah, you don't need to even write the code. If you want, you can, but there's no need. What would be your approach? My approach?

00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:08.593
It will… my approach will be to iterate over each of the numbers.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.440
23 for each number. Okay.

00:17:08.698 --> 00:17:10.698
divide each number by 2.

00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:11.231
divide each 12 by 2. Okay.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:21.155
like, using in person, I think you can use Modulus, which will give you the remainder. It won't give you the final… You're not even…

00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:16.866
Yeah. Which will… gives you the remainder…

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.840
So, you know even, right, let's say you know the event, then what? Okay, so if…

00:17:21.288 --> 00:17:23.288
Okay, so if the…

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.980
the… the values here. Let's say this is the even number. What will you do with this now?

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:27.269
If the value is zero.

00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:29.256
You'll save…

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:29.505
You'll save it in its place.

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:31.233
Okay. Then?

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:35.632
Then, we move forward to the next number, divided itself.

00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:42.245
Then, before we move forward to the next member, etc. Now, this is… this is odd, let's say, right? Yeah. Yeah, so this is odd. What would you do with this? You would probably save it to the…

00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:42.417
So this is… you will probably save it to the…

00:17:42.823 --> 00:17:45.823
plus no. So you'll… Yes, yes.

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:46.092
plus number. So you'll… Yes, you click it.

00:17:46.389 --> 00:17:48.389
Okay, so… but there's already 8.

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:48.596
Okay, so there's other…

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.620
Uh, in the last… You mean in the last… because this is a list, right? So you're using indexes? Like, would you append or…

00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:56.675
I will append it.

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:56.509
reuse index? Oh, not index.

00:17:56.979 --> 00:18:01.979
Now, there are two. And delete the number.

00:17:57.137 --> 00:18:01.137
If you append, there… now there are two…

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:09.310
Deleted straight. Yeah, delete, and then add it. If I tell you a deletion is not allowed, and by the way, not a good practice, right? Then how will you do it?

00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:08.555
Yeah, delete it, and then add it to the…

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:16.279
Okay, how can you swap these two numbers?

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:16.676
Okay, how can you strike these two numbers?

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.420
We can say, like, you can make a temporary variable.

00:18:18.537 --> 00:18:23.537
You can see, like, you can make it temporary table, and save the last name.

00:18:22.572 --> 00:18:28.572
Let's see if the last number… and then, uh, like, swap between the two.

00:18:23.873 --> 00:18:28.873
Okay, nice. And then, uh, like, swap… You got the idea, right? Yeah. Alright, nice.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.690
Okay, that's it, thank you, Mother. Uh, who's next?

00:18:29.904 --> 00:18:32.904
Okay, that's it, thank you, Walter. Uh, who's the name?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400
I don't remember.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.446
Let me check.

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:39.179
I'll just, uh, stop the recording.

00:18:37.503 --> 00:18:39.503
Just, uh, spoke to the portal.
