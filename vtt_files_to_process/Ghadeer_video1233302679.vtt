00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:03.745
Okay, so…

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:07.876
Just, uh, have a quick one, 15-20 minutes, hopefully.

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.033
Um, it's usually going a bit longer.

00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.941
We are going to just see some, like, discuss some Python basics,

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:24.723
networking basics, Linux basics, Docker basics, deployment basics, things like that, right? And then there's also, like, intermediate things, some things are…

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:27.328
Very advanced, right? So I'll quickly jump in.

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:29.497
And I will give you something.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.899
Uh, now you don't have to remember the syntax, or…

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:45.154
Don't have to worry about each and everything. I just want to know…

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.681
your logic, right? So, given this area of numbers…

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440
Um, I want you to…

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:56.874
Replace all of the numbers with their square.

00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:02.084
sparse. Like, for example, 5 becomes 25, 3 become 9.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.362
So, how would you do that in Python?

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:09.036
In Python? Yes, you can use loops, you can use lists, you can use anything you like.

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:17.354
I don't… I don't… shall they write all the code, or just one statement that's… Whatever you like, you can… you can discuss the logic.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:21.146
Write some code, just discuss the logic, whatever you like.

00:01:22.543 --> 00:01:24.543
Okay, it's power… power too, yeah.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:26.524
25 years, bottom.

00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:28.627
Um…

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.083
However, its main star.

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:39.118
Uh, we are not concerned about the mathematics, right? Logic. So you have to change… replace the list.

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:45.378
like, uh, like, for example, this should become 64, this should become 25, this should become 9.

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:51.523
Replace the elements. Same it, but before or after the 8?

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:53.527
you know, I'd start to…

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.291
Okay, then…

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:01.138
But this is…

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350
Yes, I know it's hard-coded here.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.939
But a user can give you any number, right?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.810
So, the user can give you any number.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.733
It can be any number at all. Like, it can be, maybe, it's 2.

00:02:13.707 --> 00:02:17.707
But I remember that, that, uh, we had that, uh…

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.650
It's called the task tickets. We have 10 hours.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.930
barrels.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:29.542
Something's called bar.

00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:31.672
Chuck Bashi.

00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:35.448
Uh, let's say, don't worry about libraries, right?

00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:38.252
not the libraries, I mean the…

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:43.627
That is one task you've got… that is, like, one link we join. There is a lot of tasks

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:52.301
mathematical tasks, how we can write… how we can write multiple in Python, how we can write division. Well, multiple is fine. See, you're… this is fine, this will work, but…

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:56.616
The logic of processing the list in Python, actually. Because here,

00:02:56.984 --> 00:03:00.984
How would you use loops? Like, how would you process each and every element?

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.859
Each number can be any number.

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.586
So, how would you replace it in this list?

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.759
Right? We just need to update the list.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.231
not create a new one, update the list.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:14.435
So, how would you… how would you do that?

00:03:15.268 --> 00:03:17.268
No issues.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.322
So, um…

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.139
Mr. Select, let's move forward.

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.718
So… okay.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.259
Uh, let's say…

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.262
Uh, you are building a student management system.

00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:35.398
Right? And uh…

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:40.796
As a school owner, a person wants to use your application to add students.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.570
add students, right?

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:48.114
And you have two choices. You can use a dictionary or a list.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:53.953
Or a list to store students, right? Which one would you use? And why?

00:03:54.557 --> 00:04:00.557
Yeah, like, for example, you can use a dictionary or a list to store student information.

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:07.186
Right? So, would you prefer using a dictionary over a list, or would you prefer using a list over a dictionary?

00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:09.677
In this situation.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.130
Uh, okay, dictionary, right?

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:15.004
So… Thank you.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.709
Okay, okay. So what is the benefit dictionary gives you here?

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:23.466
For example, why not use a list key?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:38.142
The list that's giving you just a set of words for dictionary, there is some information, for example, that you need to… Oh, no, no, I can do something like this, see.

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:43.147
So I have a list, right? So I can have a list of tuples, for example, student ID comes here,

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:45.937
name comes here, then comma, then I can do…

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:48.076
You mean like this?

00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:52.198
Uh, you can use the list, right? Yes. But what would you prefer, dictionary or list? Lists.

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:55.447
If we write some details in the list?

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.295
For example, the name, age, ID,

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:04.477
For example, you get some information in the list, so I prefer to make a list. So, why? Because we can change the list.

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:07.322
Uh, can we change the direction?

00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:09.694
Nope.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:11.675
Okay, so…

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:14.748
Uh, like, I… so if we… okay.

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:17.617
One moment, change…

00:05:19.244 --> 00:05:21.244
dictate. Okay, let's move forward.

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.445
Okay, let's say your application is working great, right?

00:05:27.022 --> 00:05:29.022
Uh, but when I rerun your application,

00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:31.231
I lose all of the data.

00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:35.845
Because I'm storing, like, for example, I'm storing student information in the list, right?

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:38.038
So I can see the information also.

00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:40.495
But when I close your application,

00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:43.121
And if I re-run your application…

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
Would the students' data would still be there, or not?

00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:51.023
Again, I didn't interrupt you. Yeah, yeah. So, for example, this is a list, right? Yes.

00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:56.867
Uh, when I use… let's say I'm a school owner, so I'm using your PY file.

00:05:57.278 --> 00:06:03.278
So your PY file asks, like, enter student information. Yes. So I will enter. So it saves to the list, right?

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.383
And I can view, also, view.

00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:07.842
presenters where it displays all. Yes.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.935
Let's say I exit your application.

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:12.763
Okay. And then I run it again.

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:18.517
Right? Okay. So, can I still get the student data that I stored?

00:06:18.808 --> 00:06:24.808
Before I close it, I'll save it, it will be short, but if I didn't save it, it will…

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:29.505
So you need to upload it again. Yeah, so how will you save it?

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:32.686
What's your logic for saving a student's data?

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.216
After I run. Ctrl-S.

00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:40.182
And then when you run, uh, I think, uh, there is, uh…

00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:44.056
The receiver will show down that there is table.

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:48.066
Uh, sorry, table? Stable, just like Table, if I save it…

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:54.508
Okay. Uh, like, are you talking about… okay, first we store it in a list, and also stored it where?

00:06:55.273 --> 00:07:02.273
I didn't get it. Instead of list tables, table that, Annie, student name, student IDs, student…

00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:05.075
Do we have table in Python?

00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:08.203
Like, without using any libraries.

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:12.266
Without using any libraries, no. Okay, let's say you use…

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:16.063
data frame, right? Yes. Let's say you store it in a table.

00:07:17.807 --> 00:07:19.807
Yeah, sorry.

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:23.765
Yeah, okay, let's say DataFrame, right? Let's say you store it in a table.

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:26.178
Still, if I close your program,

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:30.028
Exit your application and run it again until the table is lost.

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.017
I need to save it.

00:07:32.342 --> 00:07:37.342
somewhere. What should I do? Is there any option to keep the data persistent?

00:07:41.484 --> 00:07:45.484
Any option, so not just one. There are many options. You can just give one.

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:52.229
We've seen it before we close it, it should be seen. Yes, but save it like we are… like, for example… Like a fly.

00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:57.728
Fine rate, yeah, so save it to a file. So, what would you prefer? Like,

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:04.149
before… when we are closing the application, right? Should we store everything to the file at that point,

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:09.471
Or should we keep on stewarding to the file while we are inserting the student records, Adi?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.630
like, what would be your strategy of saving?

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.661
When the person is exiting the application, at that time, you will save everything?

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:25.965
Or when the application… Step by step. Step by step. So, when he adds, then you save, right? Add safe, add save, add save. So if…

00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:27.961
Anytime I close,

00:08:28.343 --> 00:08:32.343
The point that I have closed it, I've already seen the hollow note.

00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:36.976
Okay, let's say I exit, right? And that is saved in the file. Yes.

00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:38.841
When I run the application again,

00:08:39.803 --> 00:08:41.803
Uh, so how would it load the data?

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:45.456
back. It has to reload the data, right?

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:48.333
So, how can you do that?

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:51.553
Just concepts, right? Don't worry about syntax.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:57.395
You mean, uh, same data that I saved before I bring it back again?

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:02.399
If I have it as a file, I would open the file, it would show me the data that I have saved before.

00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:07.778
Yes, yes, like, for example, if you open the file, it will show you, right? Yes. But your program needs to…

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.923
needs it, right? Not us. Like, for example, I can see it.

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:15.339
But how can your program use the data now from the file?

00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:18.536
program use data. Yeah.

00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:23.221
If I save it as a… I… if I have, uh, blanket…

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:26.889
let's say it's TXT… see, data.txt, right? Let's say data.

00:09:27.512 --> 00:09:34.512
DX3. This is the file. I call it. It's like a function, I call it a function. Okay. Do you remember? I know, but…

00:09:34.684 --> 00:09:37.684
Is… is data functioning in Python to actually…

00:09:38.193 --> 00:09:41.193
Load data from the file. Before, when I…

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:45.939
When I put the data, if I already kept this statement as a function,

00:09:46.873 --> 00:09:48.873
Just I need to call it, so it's to bring back the data.

00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:51.011
No need to rewrite it again.

00:09:51.387 --> 00:09:56.387
Okay, so, like, just need to understand, like, what would that function do, which is loading the data?

00:09:57.322 --> 00:09:59.322
What does that function do? Like…

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:03.247
How do you load the file into the application?

00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:10.521
Uh, yeah, name of the… but there are many functions, right?

00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:19.554
Like, there are many functions, so… What I… would I write it before, I write it again. So, for example, if I do…

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:22.956
diff… for example, Radier.

00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:28.421
And then here I write some code, and then when I close this, when I open another…

00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:33.881
When I want to take this data from this file to another file, I just call this…

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:36.376
statement to others, so it will…

00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:41.221
Is this a git command, something like that? Like, this diff?

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.815
Uh, what does this div do, Hadir?

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:46.169
I would just like…

00:10:46.283 --> 00:10:50.283
Like, just, like, a phi name. I have…

00:10:50.727 --> 00:10:59.727
Okay. Okay. No, no, no, yeah, that's what I understand. Let's make it… let's, uh, I mean, rephrase the question, right? Maybe.

00:10:59.918 --> 00:11:01.918
How do you write to a file in Python?

00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:06.133
How can you write a string in a file?

00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:08.188
In Python.

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:14.009
Yes, any… anything to a file. You need to write something to a file. Hello World, let's say. How can you do that?

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.430
Yeah, then, like, write what… like, I don't want to…

00:11:20.754 --> 00:11:23.754
Yeah, don't worry about the exact names, but…

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:28.816
conceptual, right? Like, uh, how do you… how do you actually…

00:11:28.964 --> 00:11:34.964
See if something to the fight. Is there something like that in Python? If there is, like,

00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:38.114
What does it do? How does it work, actually?

00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:42.803
save something in Python? Uh, using Python? Save something to a file.

00:11:43.676 --> 00:11:45.676
using Python, right?

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:47.772
Perfect, yeah.

00:11:48.472 --> 00:11:55.472
That's good to understand. Uh, like, uh, for example, I have data.txt, right? I opened the program? Yes. I need to save Hello World.

00:11:56.047 --> 00:12:01.047
is, uh, programmatically. So you have a Python script. What would you do

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.240
to say something to that data.txt file.

00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:11.704
I need to save hello world. So, what would be the code, for example? How would the code look like, actually?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
To say hello world to a file.

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:21.222
Okay, so you open the data.txt file manually, or through Python?

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.639
CMD, if we can update it… Okay, okay.

00:12:25.504 --> 00:12:29.504
I can open… open it by the CMD. I got that file that I have saved,

00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:40.621
The title of CMD, and open code. We'll open the file, then we can make some change at the same time. It's already shown in the…

00:12:40.872 --> 00:12:49.872
Right, not right, left side, there is, like, some… a lot of fire that I haven't hooked before. Okay, no sure. So, Lex move, uh, because time is short, right? So, let's…

00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:55.816
move to, let's say, some networking basics, right? Like, for example, in Python, you can create an application, right?

00:12:56.229 --> 00:13:01.229
Uh, that application, you know, can be a client application, can be a server application, remember?

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:05.064
So, what is the difference between a client application?

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:08.259
And a server application. Correct me, server.

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:13.359
something, uh, it's do for me. For example, Google is a server.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:19.668
My clients will be, I'm client, I'm like, yeah, example is good, right? So, for example,

00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:22.181
Uh, is it possible

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.903
for Google to send you a request first.

00:13:27.146 --> 00:13:29.146
Or should… or can only you…

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.290
So, for example, you want to access Google.com, right? Yes.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:38.710
So, of course, you initiate the request first, right? Yes. Is it possible for Google to initiate the request to you?

00:13:39.023 --> 00:13:41.023
Is it possible or not? No.

00:13:41.225 --> 00:13:43.225
What's it?

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:45.386
Uh, what about webhooks?

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:49.225
webhook. Webhook? What is a webhook?

00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:52.486
I don't know, like, what pop up.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:00.294
Let's talk about…

00:14:00.157 --> 00:14:02.157
If you want to…

00:14:02.346 --> 00:14:05.346
access Google, you need to know the address, right?

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:08.939
address of Google? Address, yeah. So, what is the…

00:14:09.523 --> 00:14:11.523
let's say I want to access…

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:16.417
Google. So, what is the address of Google, actually?

00:14:17.049 --> 00:14:20.049
We all know, right, it's, like, what do you put in the browser?

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:29.821
the IP address, you mean? Okay, let's IP address, right? Let's talk about IP address. Although we do google.com, which translates to IP address, right? What is an IP address?

00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:39.982
I don't know how to explain it, but I know, because I'm a telecom engineer. Just concepts, right? Just concepts.

00:14:40.434 --> 00:14:47.434
like, uh, for example, this… Like, each phone or any, uh, laptop, it have, like, serial number.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:54.290
Okay, it has an IP address. You are saying each device has an IP address? Yeah, it's different IP address. Port.

00:14:54.992 --> 00:15:03.992
So, what's the… you also have port. Yes. Many times you will see port with the IP address, right? Yes, yes. So, what is the difference between, like, how do they work together?

00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:06.065
What is the relationship?

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:10.947
of IP address with the port. Uh, IP address, it's the, like, network.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:13.879
Address? Address, but the…

00:15:14.023 --> 00:15:16.023
Put that, uh, for…

00:15:16.111 --> 00:15:18.111
For example, if I want to share you…

00:15:18.416 --> 00:15:20.416
For you, uh, something?

00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:25.858
me and you will write, same IP address, but the port, me,

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.225
like, for example, 21 or 22.

00:15:29.587 --> 00:15:36.587
Okay. So it's differential. Okay, okay, so… Address will be seen, port can be different, right? Yes. Okay, so, for example, let's say…

00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:42.181
This is the computer. It is running 3 applications. App 1, app 2, app 3, right? Yes.

00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:46.803
So, can… can more than one application use the same port?

00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:51.606
Yes, they can use the same port, but uh… So, more than one applications can use the same port, right?

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:54.022
Okay.

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.062
on the same machine, right?

00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:03.847
On the same machine, more than one application can use the same port. Yes.

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.176
Sorry, it's UNC…

00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:18.691
Okay. Uh, let's talk about, uh, like, what is a virtual machine?

00:16:18.747 --> 00:16:20.747
Well, what do you think about a virtual machine?

00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:23.081
Okay, some application.

00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:25.186
Rocket application.

00:16:25.587 --> 00:16:28.587
So we… you mean help? How?

00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:41.241
How can you create, let's say, a virtual machine? We upload, uh, we download the Oracle. It is, uh, Oracle, this is a virtual machine. Virtual books, let's say, yeah. Yes, Virtual Joint Box. And then we can access what, uh…

00:16:41.952 --> 00:16:46.952
What type of food we want, what we want, like clinics. Okay. Uh, open up.

00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:50.912
And then we can create our own. It's like…

00:16:51.288 --> 00:17:01.288
Device and side effects. Okay. We have windows, insiders, we have, like, Linux. What is the difference between a virtual machine and a Docker container?

00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:05.487
virtual machine. Android worker container. Uh…

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:11.401
Dog roots in a container, so we can… we can open, for example, one project.

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:17.467
that that project, uh, instead of downloading the whole… too much… a lot of apps,

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.570
We can just run it.

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:25.616
I get your point, I understand. There's a… Yeah, but the version machine that we can…

00:17:25.706 --> 00:17:27.706
carry it on our own.

00:17:29.578 --> 00:17:31.578
So, uh, like, uh, I mean…

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.880
Can we not do everything in the virtual machine?

00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:38.824
Because whatever we are doing in the container,

00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:43.457
We can do the same thing in the virtual machine, right? Yes.

00:17:44.176 --> 00:17:52.176
then why container? Uh, like, yes, I understand your point, like, you were saying, so there's not… Because it's easier, and it's, uh, take less time.

00:17:53.025 --> 00:18:05.025
And, uh, it's, uh… You think writing Dockerfile and everything, Docker Compose is easy, versus just installing Ubuntu and just…

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:08.686
But I got your point, somehow. There's a small thing, it's okay.

00:18:09.509 --> 00:18:15.509
I got your point. I will tell you about it later, right? Like, I'm just putting this so we can revise certain things.

00:18:16.808 --> 00:18:18.808
So, we…

00:18:27.963 --> 00:18:29.963
Okay, uh…

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.861
get, right? We have practiced a lot of Git.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.760
Uh, what is a… what is a branch in Git, and…

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:43.669
How does a branch relate to commit? What is the relationship between a branch and a commit?

00:18:44.318 --> 00:18:46.318
Brian, can you comment? Committee.

00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:49.239
branch, it's, like, 3. We have, like…

00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:53.967
Okay. A lot of branches. We work in different, but in one…

00:18:55.375 --> 00:19:00.375
One main branch. Main branch operators. Branch?

00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:03.821
And, uh, comment, it's like staging area.

00:19:04.637 --> 00:19:11.637
That we can save? Yes, Summit is like a staging. Commit is a staging area, or is like a staging area there? Staging.

00:19:11.745 --> 00:19:13.745
It's a staging area, okay.

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:24.371
So, there's no difference between a staging area and a commentary.

00:19:24.453 --> 00:19:29.453
Yes. Okay. Uh, I think that's… uh, yeah, last thing, sorry. Yeah, AI agents, right?

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:34.550
Just simple, like, what do you think about eA agents? Like, what is an AI agent versus LLM?

00:19:37.183 --> 00:19:40.183
Like, for example, what is the difference between ChatGPT? Uh-huh.

00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:42.614
And an AI agent.

00:19:45.145 --> 00:19:47.145
Seems to… shit.

00:19:52.287 --> 00:19:55.287
AI agent, I think you can create your…

00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:57.266
like ChatGPT bio.

00:19:57.923 --> 00:20:01.923
Great foot. Chatwood. Okay, okay.

00:20:02.107 --> 00:20:05.107
Okay, thank you, Vadr. I think time is already…

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:09.837
flow, right? Uh, now, next is… let me…
