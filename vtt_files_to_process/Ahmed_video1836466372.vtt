00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:03.056
Uh, hopefully, so…

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.370
Uh, hopefully we'll keep just, uh, spectators within 20 minutes or so.

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:08.198
20 minutes, hopefully, right? Yeah, 20 minutes, cool. Yeah, my micros are perfect.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.700
Yeah, you've been just hoping to get in. Are you surviving? The most important thing? How's your bank?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Maybe you are in an advantage because I just… Yeah, you've been there. I just want to just get done with it. Are you surviving? The most important thing? How's your back?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:24.950
That's what you want. So, in this interview, uh, like, we will just focus on a few things, like part of this, right?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
That's what's wrong. So, in this interview, I had, like,

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.759
Just, uh, focus on a few things, like Python Basics, some intermediate things, networking, you have Linux, Git,

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:37.756
Docker, things related to deployment, right? Inshallah. So, maybe I'll just skip maybe a few basic things, because maybe you know basics, right? Inshallah. Just jump to some, uh, some…

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:37.939
Inshallah. So, maybe I can just skip maybe a few basic things here, maybe no basics, right? Inshallah.

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:42.873
things that will cover all of the basics, maybe, right? So, let's say you have a list, right?

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:43.201
things that we cover, all of the basics, maybe, right? So you have on this, right?

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:45.082
with the… okay.

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:45.298
with, uh… Okay.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.059
Uh…

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:53.228
Uh… when we play planning poker, have you seen when we play planning poker? The numbers appear, right? Yeah, there are some numbers.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:57.482
When we create planning for graph, you see? When we click planning poker, the numbers appear, right? Yeah, there are some numbers appearing. And the number appears, like, something like this, like 0, 1.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.259
And the number appears, like, something like this, like, 0, 1.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.335
Yeah, and for example, then you have one, then two, then three, then…

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:01.712
Okay. And, for example, then you have funds that do, then three, then…

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.596
5, then 8.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.152
Like, 5 to 8, then 21.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.069
than 21. Gotcha. Right?

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.032
Got it. Great. So…

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:09.584
So, if you see what's actually happening,

00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:09.253
If you see what's actually happening,

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.382
is you're actually…

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.591
is you're actually…

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:23.368
adding. Yeah, the two previous numbers, and getting the one. Then again, you add two previous numbers, you get the third. Exactly. Then again, you add the two previous, you get three, right? Then you add these two, you get 5, right?

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:14.585
Yeah.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.719
two previous numbers, then getting the one done. Again, you add two previous numbers, you get the… Exactly. Then again, you add the two previous, you get 3.

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.583
Yeah.

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:25.558
And you add 5 or 3 in bed.

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.961
and you add 5 or 3, you get 8.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310
And then you add 8 plus…

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:28.473
And then you had 8 plus…

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.891
5, and you get… Okay.

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.226
5 and even 13. Okay.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:35.624
And then you add 13 plus 8, you get 21, right? Got it. So…

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.832
And then you add 13 plus 8, you get 25, right? Got it. So…

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:50.809
No need to, like, worry about the syntax, if you want to write, you can write. If you just want to discuss, you can discuss. I'll discuss better for me. What would be your logic to generate this kind of a sequence, given?

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:51.167
Uh, just no need to, like, worry about the syntax, if you want to write, you can write if you just want to discuss, you can discuss. I'll discuss with them for me. What would be your logic to generate this kind of a sequence, given?

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:52.796
Given that you already have ZMand 1.

00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:52.997
Given that you already have Z vendor.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:56.644
Given that I already have…

00:01:54.225 --> 00:02:05.225
Given that I already have… You already have the first two numbers, right? Okay. Equal to zero, let's say, and be equal to 1, already given to you, right? Now, what would be your logic? You can make use of loops, you can do anything you like.

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:04.499
Okay. E equal to 0, that's say, and B equal to 1 already given to it, right? Now, what would be on the J? You can make use of boom, you can…

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:09.354
Anything you might do actually create the sequence and just stop when it's triggered.

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:09.222
to actually generate this sequence and just stop when it's still given.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:12.303
So, the first thing that came to mind…

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:12.492
So, the first thing that came to mind…

00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:14.392
is, uh…

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.591
is, uh…

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:18.862
I'll have, uh, I'll define N as a number.

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:22.028
I'll have, uh, I'll define N as a number, then after that, I'll make N plus 1,

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
Then, after that, I'll make N plus 1.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.375
End plus B or plus 1?

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:24.753
And plus B or plus 1?

00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:29.118
N plus B. Sorry, I'll make it N plus B.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.340
N plus B. So, yeah, I'll make it N plus B.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:36.733
Oh yeah, so I'm trying to imagine right now how… You can also write if you want to. Yeah. For example, what you are trying to do is… and… and…

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:36.256
I'm trying to imagine right now how… Yeah. For example, what you are trying to do is…

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.009
set N to A here, then you do N plus, uh, let's say B, right?

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:42.206
And you said N20, then you do N plus, let's say, P, right?

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.033
Yeah. So, whatever, like, let's say, for example,

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:46.413
Yeah. So, whatever, like, let's say, for example,

00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:49.203
We have, uh…

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
We have, uh… you said we already have zero and one.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:52.121
You said we already have zero and one, right?

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:54.678
Then, we will, like…

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.990
Then, we will, like…

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:56.885
We add the number…

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:57.228
We add the number…

00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:02.982
means you add the number you want one. Yes. You add 0 and 1, you want… Yeah, exactly. I got one. Where would you store one? So, can I…

00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:03.283
If you add the number equivalent. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I go 20. So, can I…

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.625
Can I loop? Can I loop, and uh…

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:06.904
Like, can I loop? Can I loop, and uh…

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.459
How can I explain this? You can run the loop? Yeah.

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:10.745
How can I explain this? You can run the route? Yeah.

00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:12.596
1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:12.728
Right.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.320
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times. Yeah. You can run the loop 6 times. Let's say it's running 6 times. Okay. You just need to print.

00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:21.368
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 strings. Yeah. You can run the loop 6 strings. Let's say it's running 6 strings. Okay. You just need to print.

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:27.078
You just need to print, let's say, one first, then two firsts, then three, five, eight, twenty. Gotcha, okay.

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.421
You just need to print, let's say, one first, then two first, then three, five, eight, and…

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:28.516
Got it, okay?

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:32.404
So… And take your time. Like, take 2 minutes, think about, right? And then…

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:32.595
Take 2 minutes, think about it, right?

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:37.961
And you can even write, or draw, whatever you like.

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:36.127
And you can even write? Yeah.

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.276
Or draw, or whatever you like.

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:40.268
Okay, so…

00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:40.611
Okay.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.528
Can you import that?

00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:50.872
tend to be important, huh?

00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:53.515
That's not an option?

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.770
That's not an option.

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:57.716
So…

00:03:56.098 --> 00:03:58.098
So…

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:03.213
I'm going to have…

00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:03.802
I'm trying to have…

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:05.696
An answer that's clear.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.009
And answer, that's clear.

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:08.528
Just nail it.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.500
So, Mr. What I'll do is number, first of all, like, let's say, starting with 1, it'll be 1 plus B, and uh…

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.690
Um, so what I'll do is each number, first of all, like, let's say, starting with 1,

00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:55.762
It'll be 1 plus B, and uh… then we'll…

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:57.561
then we'll… can we loop and, like…

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.926
Can we loop and, like,

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:00.876
I'm trying to think of the right word for each…

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.290
I'm trying to think of the right word for each name.

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:02.856
like, let's say, for example, one,

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.169
like, let's say, for example, one…

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:13.539
It'll be added… will add one to this, then we'll add one to this, and going on. So, is the correct word, is looping? Like, loops, right? Yeah, a loop the list, but uh…

00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:12.297
It'll be added… we'll add one to this, and we'll add one to this, and going on. So, is the correct word, is looping? Like, loops? Yeah, I'll loop the list.

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:14.411
But, uh…

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:34.215
Or maybe you can just generate the next number. Loop is fixed, so it will run 6 times. Yeah, it'll run 6 times, that's all. The hint is, is you can also try to upgrade these. Like, for example… I can upgrade, yeah, like, so let's add C, you mean, like, add… No, no, like, for example, A0 and B is 1, right? Yeah. And you already have N also. Yeah. So, what you can do is, when you move forward… Yeah.

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:17.335
Or maybe you can just generate the next number.

00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:24.004
Yeah, it'll run 6 times, that's what… The hint is, is you can also try to upgrade these.

00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:30.647
I can upgrade… yeah, so let's add C, you mean, like, adding… No, like, for example, A is 0 means 1, right? Yeah. And you already have N also.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.414
Yeah, so what you can do is, when you move forward… Yeah.

00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.441
Think about it, right? So when you move forward,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.630
think about it, right? So when you move forward,

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:46.108
So, automatically, A becomes 1 now, and B become 1. Yeah. And when you move forward again, so now A becomes 1 and B become 2, then it's forward, so… Yeah. Yeah, so…

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:46.415
So, automatically, A becomes 1 now, and B become one. Yeah. And when you move forward again, so now A becomes 1 and B become 2. Yeah, becomes 2. Yeah, yeah, so…

00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:58.753
Is there anything coming in your mind? Like, I know, see, this question is actually, uh, solved best when you actually try it out. Exactly, that's… I'm trying… So, I will give you another one, right? Okay. Forget about it. Yes, I will give you another one.

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:55.233
Is there anything coming in your mind? You know, see, this question is actually, uh, solved best when you actually… Exactly, that's… I'm trying…

00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:58.891
Okay.

00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:02.435
So, the other one is this. Let's say you have, uh…

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:02.735
So, the other one is this. Let's say you have, uh…

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.155
B, uh, 3?

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:10.545
2, 3, and 4, 1, and 6, and let's say 1 and 3, right?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:10.866
And… and space, and let's say 1 and 3, space.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.430
Okay.

00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:12.827
Okay.

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:15.946
There's something called Target. Yeah.

00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:16.298
There's something for target. Yeah.

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.479
And I think we are supposed to have done it.

00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:19.793
I think we are responsible for have done that.

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.599
Back in the days, and let's say target is 5, right? Okay.

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:23.938
Back in the days, yeah. That's your target is fun, right? Okay.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.599
So,

00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:25.777
So,

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.584
Uh…

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.096
need your logic.

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:30.404
need your logic. Yeah.

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.975
to figure out which two numbers you can add to…

00:06:31.173 --> 00:06:34.173
to figure out which two numbers you can add to…

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.590
which two numbers we can add to get 5? You get 5, but as soon as you find those two numbers, you print those two numbers.

00:06:34.912 --> 00:06:40.912
which two numbers we can add to get 5? We got 5, but as soon as you find those two numbers, you print those two.

00:06:41.278 --> 00:06:43.278
Can't we add all of those and divide them?

00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:43.611
Can't we add all of those and divide them?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.460
like, uh…

00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:45.897
like, uh…

00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:50.178
Like, for example, fiber, for example. The output will look like this. Let me show you the output.

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:50.269
Like, for example, right? For example, the output will look like this.

00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.192
Output will look like this, like, two, uh…

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.471
output will look like this, like two, uh…

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.909
2 and 3. Okay. And 4 and 1?

00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:58.226
to entry. Okay. And 4 and 1.

00:06:58.102 --> 00:07:00.102
And that's it, just too.

00:07:00.096 --> 00:07:02.096
So, output will…

00:07:01.277 --> 00:07:03.277
outputable.

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:04.829
give you 2 and 3 and 2 and 1.

00:07:03.252 --> 00:07:05.252
give you 2 and 3 and 4 and 1.

00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:10.695
If you want an order, because if you had 2 and 3, plus 5, if you had 4 and 1 and… It'll become 5.

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:11.121
If you want in a stream or not, because if you had 2 and 3, it becomes 5. Yeah, it'll become 5.

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:12.771
But…

00:07:10.974 --> 00:07:12.974
But…

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:18.126
Yeah, just two numbers. It should not be more than two. It cannot be 3 plus 1 plus 1. Yeah.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.510
Just two numbers, yeah, true numbers. So nothing more than two, it cannot be 3 plus 1 plus 1. Yeah.

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:23.799
So, the only thing you need to note is you have to scan the list,

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:24.126
Got it, got it. So, the only thing you need to do is, you have to scan the list

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.477
Okay? To get 5. And as soon as…

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.894
Okay? To get 5. And as soon as…

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.700
two numbers matches 5, you plant it.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.010
two numbers matches 5, you get it.

00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:32.161
reasonably. Okay, so…

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:32.488
Okay, so…

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:35.152
So it's just… we add…

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.350
So it's just, like, we add…

00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:43.512
two numbers, then, like, let's say, for example, 2 and 3, and we get 5. So, but you want to know what… What would the condition, like, what would be the condition, actually?

00:07:36.278 --> 00:07:42.278
two numbers, then, like, let's say, for example, 2 and 3, and we get 5. So, but you want to know what the condition, like…

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.170
If? If… yeah, it'll be an if statement. If, uh…

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958
Yeah, if… yeah, it'll be… if statement, if, uh…

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:51.828
And if, uh, your index is right, yeah, indexes, so…

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.281
If, uh… Yeah, indexes, so…

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.373
let's say if…

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:55.708
let's say if…

00:07:56.224 --> 00:08:01.224
0. Okay, let's start with the first number, right? So you start with the first number here. Yeah, which is 2.

00:07:56.304 --> 00:08:01.304
zero. Okay, let's start with the first one, right? So you start with the first number. Yeah, which is 2.

00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:05.624
But in the index at zero. Yes. Yeah. Then how will you run the… run it?

00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:03.887
But in the index, it's zero. Yes. Yeah.

00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:05.887
then how will you run the… run it?

00:08:06.524 --> 00:08:10.524
I just want to, like, understand the logic of printing with the peers.

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:11.169
I just want to, like, understand the logic of printing the beers.

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:15.764
let's say if, uh…

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.010
let's say if, uh…

00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:22.178
trying to generate the right words. You don't need the right terminology, right?

00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:21.374
science and read the right words. You don't need the right terminology, right?

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.370
Okay, let's…

00:08:24.993 --> 00:08:29.993
And you can take your time, you can think about it, don't… don't… don't be worried, right? Just think about it.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.120
Do you take your time to think about it, to…

00:08:28.394 --> 00:08:30.394
Don't be worried, wait, just think about it.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
thinking about it a little bit.

00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:34.588
thinking of ways.

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:52.482
We're not supposed to define anything right now, right? Yeah, but I can tell you… so, for example, when you start here… Yeah.

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:52.955
We're not supposed to define anything like that, right? Yeah, but I… so, for example, when you start here… Yeah.

00:08:53.668 --> 00:09:00.668
you are going to run the loop how many times? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 times only. Yeah. Why? Because…

00:08:53.858 --> 00:09:00.858
you are going to run the loop how many times? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… 6 times only. Yeah. Why?

00:09:01.122 --> 00:09:06.122
When… when you, uh, when you look at this item, automatically you are going to compare it with the next.

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:07.696
When you, uh, when you look at this item, automatically you're going to compare it with the test. Yeah, exactly, that's…

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:10.774
Yeah, exactly, that's… So now, using this project, how can you actually figure out…

00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:11.137
So now, using this logic, how can you actually figure out…

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.300
Just if condition is needed present. Yeah, so…

00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:14.704
just if condition is needed, right? Yeah, so…

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:23.443
Yeah, that's… that's the thing in my mind, because, you know, yeah.

00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:24.713
Figure out, like, where I stood, or what? Yeah, that's the thing in my mind, because, you know, when it comes… yeah, so here, for example…

00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:26.871
It's, uh, this has been cut.

00:09:25.492 --> 00:09:28.492
is, uh, this is going to happen. Let's say 4. Yeah.

00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:28.931
let's say 4. Yeah.

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:33.935
Um, and I will say… let's say I, right, is the index. Yeah.

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:34.419
I would say… let's say I, right?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.407
In…

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.839
change…

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:42.319
And this is… let's say there's L, yeah?

00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:46.895
And for I and range, uh, length of L.

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:49.264
Okay.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.457
Right? And length of L minus 1, so…

00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:51.738
Right, and let the fail-minus control.

00:09:51.731 --> 00:10:02.731
So, I will be… I will become zero automatically the first time, then I will become 1, 1, then I will become 2, I will become 3, and it will stop at 4, 5, right? Yeah, it will stop here.

00:09:52.449 --> 00:10:00.449
disruption. So, I will be… I will become zero automatically the first time, then I will become 1, then I will become 2, I will become the thing, and it will stop.

00:10:00.763 --> 00:10:02.763
At 4, 5. Yeah, let us stop here.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.353
Uh, it's fine. Yeah, so here…

00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:05.513
That's fine. Yeah, so… Yeah.

00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:08.593
Uh, now here you have…

00:10:06.752 --> 00:10:08.752
Uh, now here you have…

00:10:08.988 --> 00:10:10.988
If you do L, I,

00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:11.413
If you do L, I,

00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:20.801
Yeah. Here, so you get automatically too. Yeah, I'll get two. If you do I plus 1, you get 3 automatically, right? Yeah, totally. So, like, uh, what would be the formula to actually

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:18.212
Yeah. Yeah, so you get automatically 2. Yeah, I'll get two. If you do I plus one, you get 3. Yeah, so… so…

00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:20.837
like, uh, what would be the formula to actually

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:29.185
Like, what would be the condition if, like, what would be the condition? I, and then just to clarify, for I and range of…

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.971
Like, what would be the condition?

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:29.499
I… just to clarify, for I in range of…

00:10:29.771 --> 00:10:36.771
You just have to fill this condition. This is correct, this is correct, now here. So, I refers to, like, uh… Index. The index.

00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:37.094
You just have to find this condition. So, I refers to, like, the index.

00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:40.954
So… If you have L0, it means to first element.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
So… If you have L0, plus 2.

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.395
Perfect. Okay, so…

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:45.827
Okay, so… and 0… It means first element, right? Yeah. So…

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:45.243
It means first order. Yeah.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.230
So… Yeah.

00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:48.155
Yeah. L…

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:50.871
And… So after effort to input, yeah.

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:50.536
So after F, what do you put here?

00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:52.655
I'll put…

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:52.851
I'll put…

00:10:57.542 --> 00:11:02.542
I just want to put 2 plus 3, but I'm trying… Is this LI, so you put LI?

00:10:57.796 --> 00:11:02.796
I just want to put two mini… 2 plus 3, but I'm trying. So you put LI?

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:07.128
L, and I, inside I. Yeah. Plus…

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
L and I?

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:07.625
So, you know? Yeah. Plus…

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:10.052
L, I minus 1. I minus 1, sorry.

00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:10.343
L, I minus 1. I-13.

00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:12.391
Inside the brackets, i plus 1.

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:12.525
Sorry, sorry, the buckets, I need this one.

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:17.357
Uh, I? This one. This one. Now, let's say you have this, right? Okay. Now, this is 2 and 3.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:17.673
Aye? This one. Now, let's say you have this, right? Okay. Now, this is 283.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.580
Yeah. And now compare it with what, like…

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:19.882
Yeah. And now compare it with what, like…

00:11:20.324 --> 00:11:23.324
You also have the variables here. Yeah, yeah.

00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:24.531
You're going… you also have the variable here. Yeah, yeah. So…

00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:25.309
So…

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:30.464
Double equal to, or greater than, or what, like… Double equal to, okay, yes, put double equal to a number.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.684
double equal to, or greater than what?

00:11:28.749 --> 00:11:30.749
put double equal to, yes, put double equal to.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.442
And double equal to the…

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:34.561
And double equal to the…

00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:37.022
5. The target? Which is target.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.152
Five, the target, which is the target?

00:11:38.888 --> 00:11:41.888
And if it matches, if it's true, for example, then you print what?

00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:42.141
And if it mentions, for example, then you predict what?

00:11:42.677 --> 00:11:44.677
So here, right print?

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:44.966
It's not here, right, Brent?

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.455
But what footprint? What will be the variables that you will print?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.520
But what fully do to the variable?

00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:59.372
Is it the target, or…? We have to print the numbers, like… Yeah, this and this.

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:59.806
Is it the target? No, wait. We have to print the numbers, like, this and this.

00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:02.181
So, print 2 and 3? Yeah.

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:02.444
So, print 2 and 3? Yeah.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:07.295
No, no, but, like, 2 and 3, you cannot hard-code it, right? Yeah. So…

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:07.583
No, no, but, like, 2 or 3, you cannot hardcode it, right? Yeah, so…

00:12:09.804 --> 00:12:11.804
Uh, you already have…

00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:13.357
Uh, you already have done it. Yeah. Think about it.

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:24.835
Can I do, uh, yeah.

00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:25.239
Can I do… yeah.

00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.941
Just tell me, give me ideas.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.220
Just tell me and give me ideas.

00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:30.099
Yes. So, are you afraid of it.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.110
So, I refers to the…

00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:34.729
You already have 10X, which is zero, yeah.

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:34.836
You already have index, which is zero, yeah.

00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:36.704
So…

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.790
So…

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:46.419
Should I write L, which is… Right, right, right, L, and then, in the square brackets, what will come?

00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:46.512
Should they write L, which is… and then in the Scribe package, what will come?

00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:51.464
to lower, like, index, right? Zero?

00:12:47.687 --> 00:12:51.687
Two, uh, newer, like, index, right? Zero.

00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:56.183
But you cannot write the number, you can… you have to use the variables here. I have to use the variable, which is…

00:12:52.653 --> 00:12:56.653
No, no, no. You have to use the variable the same. I have to use the variable, which is…

00:12:56.804 --> 00:13:00.804
I right now. Yeah. So I… I can…

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.200
I right now. Yeah. I 0, means 2, right? So I even put here. I plus, yeah, I… like, you're just printing, right? Yeah.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.610
I plus, yeah, I… like, I just put them right here.

00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:06.809
So, I plus…

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.990
So, I plus…

00:13:06.914 --> 00:13:08.914
If you write 1, it becomes 3 automatically.

00:13:06.963 --> 00:13:08.963
If you write 1, it becomes 3 automatically.

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:14.037
two… no, not two anymore, like, it will become three. Because, uh, 3 is the next number.

00:13:09.607 --> 00:13:12.607
not to any good, like, it will become 3.

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.605
So, the next number.

00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:17.412
So, I just select index, right?

00:13:15.988 --> 00:13:19.988
So it's just like the index, right? Yeah. So one.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.396
Yeah, so one?

00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:25.145
Now, this… you are… you have to pay printing. You are printing 3 now. Yeah. But you also need to print 2 also.

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:25.386
Now, this… you are… you have to… Yeah, yeah. You are putting freedom. Yeah. But you also need to print tools.

00:13:26.324 --> 00:13:28.324
I need to plant two. Can I also…

00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:31.875
I need to… can I… yes, just put comma… Yeah.

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:32.485
It's just a comma and… Yeah, plus?

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:36.144
Plus, or…? Uh, no need for plus, just fine, just printed.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.981
Directly.

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:43.604
Plus… okay. Two?

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:44.019
Let's… okay.

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.667
Uh, no.

00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:45.953
Uh, no.

00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:49.848
If you write 1, it will again become 3. Yeah. But we need 2.

00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:49.975
If you write 1, it will again become 3. Yeah. But we need 2.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.267
Zero. Yeah, do, right?

00:13:50.432 --> 00:13:52.432
Zilli. Yeah, two, right?

00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:57.455
Or you can just completely remove plus, you know, because plus zero is nothing. Yeah, exactly.

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:59.867
Or… or you would just completely remove plus, you know, but plus you use nothing. Yeah, exactly. So, just like, you know, so…

00:13:57.801 --> 00:13:59.801
Just, yeah, zero.

00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:06.102
Because I… I mean, by default equal to this. So, yeah, there's a pretty… okay.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.580
Because I… So, yeah, no, this is… right? Okay.

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:10.244
So, let's… okay, let's see how you are designing.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:17.117
So, let's move… okay, let's see everything we're designing, and anonymous feedback system, right? Okay. Yeah. So people actually may…

00:14:11.353 --> 00:14:15.353
Yeah, and anonymous feedback system, right? Okay. You see recognis factors that we do, right? Yeah.

00:14:15.192 --> 00:14:17.192
People actually, uh…

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.270
your client needs an application sheet.

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:20.585
your client needs an application,

00:14:20.654 --> 00:14:25.654
Where you can actually use it to get feedback, a lot of feedback, right? The client needs feedback.

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:32.321
Where you can actually use it to get feedback, a lot of feedback. The client needs an application to get feedback. Get feedback, okay. So, for example, it tells you, can you please create your application for me?

00:14:25.913 --> 00:14:32.913
So, for example, it tells you, Amit, can you please create an application for me? Okay.

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:34.573
Okay. Uh, and…

00:14:33.986 --> 00:14:36.986
Uh, and, uh, just give me a Python application.

00:14:35.211 --> 00:14:37.211
Uh, just give me a final application.

00:14:37.055 --> 00:14:42.055
that I can actually share with people, so they can actually give their feedback. Okay.

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:42.333
that they can actually share with people so they can actually get their feedback, okay?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.130
But now, the thing is that, because they're…

00:14:43.408 --> 00:14:45.408
But now, the thing is that, because we are…

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:49.436
There are so many people, even with hundreds.

00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:49.875
There are so many people, you can agree, right? There are hundreds.

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.278
So there is traffic. So, yeah, let's say there's traffic right here.

00:14:50.539 --> 00:14:53.539
So that is the traffic. So, yeah, that's a piece of traffic.

00:14:53.374 --> 00:14:55.374
You have to strobe all of the feedback.

00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:55.511
You have to extrude all of the feedback.

00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.309
Okay. But the only two options you have is that they're understood, right?

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.540
Quickly. The only two options you have is either a list or a notch, right?

00:15:00.177 --> 00:15:02.177
either a list or a chicken.

00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:04.452
either a list or a dictionary, right? So, which one would you choose?

00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:04.297
So, which one would you choose?

00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:09.761
If, let's say, if there are too many feedbacks coming in, and you have to restore it,

00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:08.744
If, let's say, if there are too many feedbacks coming in,

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.309
After a student, super fast.

00:15:10.074 --> 00:15:12.074
super fast, so…

00:15:11.775 --> 00:15:14.775
So, would you choose a list, or would you choose a dictionary?

00:15:12.542 --> 00:15:14.542
Would you choose a list, or would you choose a dictionary?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.240
You told me, just to clarify, you told me that, uh, like, there is lots of

00:15:16.544 --> 00:15:18.544
You told me to clarify.

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.984
told me that, uh, like, there is lots of

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.962
Traffic, uh…

00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:23.182
traffic, and uh…

00:15:24.062 --> 00:15:26.062
like, the client wants…

00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:26.431
like, the client wants…

00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:32.765
just feedbacks from, like, this. Don't worry about AI, this is… imagine you had… you have a proper setup,

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:33.092
just feedbacks from, like, don't worry about… Yeah, you are having a lot of data.

00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:35.124
Continues.

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:35.316
Yeah, continuously, as I change it, like…

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Am I going to change the data? Is it, like… not right now. Right now,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.450
Am I going to change this data? Is it, like… Not right now. Right now?

00:15:39.393 --> 00:15:42.393
The question is simply just, would you prefer…

00:15:40.578 --> 00:15:43.578
The question is simply just, would you prefer… would you prefer?

00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:44.991
We prefer storing it in a dictionary?

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.511
Storing it in a dictionary, or others? Can I ask one more question? What type of data is it?

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.839
or a list. Can I ask one more question? What type of data is it? You said just a string. A string.

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:54.482
Street. Feedback is just a street, right? Yeah, yeah. So, yes, of course.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.280
Feedback is just a string, right? Yeah, yeah. So, yes, of course,

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:56.955
With the string, you can have the username also. Yeah.

00:15:55.107 --> 00:15:59.107
The string, you can have the username also. Yeah. Or email, right? I'll use a dictionary.

00:15:57.148 --> 00:15:59.148
I use a dictionary.

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:01.826
Oh, yeah. What would be the reason for using a dictionary?

00:15:59.974 --> 00:16:01.974
What are the reason for using…

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:05.556
Um, because they will be, like, a key value,

00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:05.853
Um, because they would be, like, a key value.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.270
That's, uh… how can I explain this? For a dictionary,

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:10.563
That's, uh… how can I explain… for a dictionary?

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:15.233
Because you're not just storing, you know, like, numbers, you're storing data.

00:16:11.372 --> 00:16:15.372
Because you're not just storing, you know, like, numbers, you're storing data.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.340
So…

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600
So…

00:16:18.216 --> 00:16:27.216
But where is storing the data, right? Yeah. Please remember, you are storing very fast. Yeah. You are not reading very fast, you are storing more. I'm storing very fast, and you are not reading, but you can also read

00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:27.501
But you're storing the data, right? Because remember, you're storing very fast, but you're not dealing with very fast. So, our story verifies. First, we do not complete, but you can also need

00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:29.385
If you want, but reading is…

00:16:27.794 --> 00:16:29.794
If you want my greediness,

00:16:29.992 --> 00:16:34.992
Uh, something that is rarely people do in that system, but people store a lot, so…

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:33.679
Uh, something that is… rarely people do here in that system.

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:35.555
But people are still remote, so…

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:44.763
And let's say you use dictionary, because you can actually define… Yeah, you can define, you have a K-value and all of those things. Yeah. But you told me since it's, uh…

00:16:35.982 --> 00:16:41.982
And let's say you use dictionary because you can actually define… Yeah, you can define… you have a key value and none of those things.

00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:45.153
Yeah. But, uh, you told me since it's, uh…

00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:47.755
Trolling rapidly, yeah. So…

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.089
student here. So…

00:16:48.213 --> 00:16:59.213
It's fine, you can stick with the author also. Sometimes I will… I'll say, I'm trying… I'm sticking with the answer, but I can try to confuse you, but don't get confused, right? Forgot to talk. So, yeah, are you sure…

00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:57.006
Sometimes I will try to confuse. We are sticking with the answer, but I'm trying to confuse you? Yeah, don't get confused, right?

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.719
Gotcha, doctor.

00:16:59.844 --> 00:17:03.844
I'll go with that. I'll show you go with the… I will say something about it.

00:17:00.112 --> 00:17:04.112
I'll go in the direction.

00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:06.066
I'll go with the dictionary. Okay.

00:17:04.308 --> 00:17:09.308
I'll go with the dictionary. Okay, so now, let's say…

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.290
So, now, yeah?

00:17:08.858 --> 00:17:10.858
supplication.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.612
this application that you have developed, right? Okay.

00:17:11.838 --> 00:17:17.838
Okay? If someone exits your application exits, right?

00:17:12.607 --> 00:17:17.607
you are storing, let's say, in a dictionary. Okay. If someone exits your application, exits, like,

00:17:18.126 --> 00:17:20.126
Alternative, yeah. Great.

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.209
Yeah.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.080
And then reruns the application here. So, of course, there's no data. Do you think the data will…

00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:23.102
And then rerun the certification. Yeah.

00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:27.594
Of course, there's good data. Do you think the data will still be there, or do you think…

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:30.358
Or do you think the dictionary will be empty when you re-run the application?

00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:30.684
when you re-run that picture.

00:17:32.642 --> 00:17:37.642
When I arrive on the application… Yes. Because you are just storing an additional… Yeah, I'm storing in headaches.

00:17:33.065 --> 00:17:38.065
Yes, because you were just talking about the idea of selling it at yourself.

00:17:38.418 --> 00:17:40.418
You define a dictionary, store it? Yeah.

00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:40.707
define it externally, store it? Yeah.

00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:45.951
Exit the application. It's not running anymore. Yeah. And then you again start

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:44.261
Excerpt application. Start running anyway. Yeah.

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:46.259
And you can't start

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:47.797
Application point. Yeah.

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:48.956
Yeah, just like…

00:17:48.374 --> 00:17:58.374
Just like if you are playing a game and you save them, if you forget to save the mission and you close the game. If I don't save the mission and I try to come back to it, let me speak when it comes to the gaming, though.

00:17:49.926 --> 00:17:52.926
If you are playing a game and you see them. If you forget to send permission…

00:17:53.738 --> 00:17:58.738
If I don't see permission and I try to come back to it, let me speak when it comes to gaming time.

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:05.516
If it's not seen, then it's not seen. Of course you cannot look. Yeah, I cannot load it one second.

00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:08.705
If it's not saved, then it's not there. Of course, you cannot load it. Yeah, I cannot load it once I close. Now, think about dictionary users, right? Yeah. So, when you run, at that time, you define it, actually. Yeah.

00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:08.868
So, at that time, the defined prediction? Yeah.

00:18:09.515 --> 00:18:11.515
While it's running, people are adding it, right? But when it exists…

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.839
Why don't people understand, right? But when it actually keeps…

00:18:11.747 --> 00:18:16.747
That's not safe, no, I cannot go back. Right, so when you run it again, again, everything will be empty, or…?

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:17.029
Sorry, so when you run it against, so again, everything would be empty, or…

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:24.765
Would you get the old data? I'll get the Python script that's… yeah. Yeah. Yes, you have the Python script. Yeah, I'll just have the… Do you have the data, the feedbacks?

00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:24.967
But you get the old data. I'll get the finance script that's… yeah. Yes, you have the… yeah, I'll just have the… Do you have to get other feedbacks?

00:18:25.432 --> 00:18:27.432
The feedbacks that people have… If it's not safe,

00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:29.906
the feedbacks that people are… if it's not saved, then no. Yeah. It was saved in dictionary.

00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.685
Yeah, it was saved in between.

00:18:29.812 --> 00:18:31.812
Okay, but when you exit your application…

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:32.112
Okay, but when you exit your application…

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:42.813
Right? So, where is the dictionary? When you exit the application, right? But it'll be saved as a key value if… as a value. Yeah, in the dictionary. In the dictionary itself. But let's say you exit the Python script, exit.

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:43.192
Right? Yeah. But it will be saved as a key value if I'm just… As a value. Yeah. In the dictionary. In the dictionary itself. But let's say you exit the Python script, exit.

00:18:43.474 --> 00:18:48.474
Then it's not saved. Because when you close dictionary post where, like, it disappears, or…?

00:18:43.694 --> 00:18:48.694
Then it's not secret. It disappears, or…?

00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:50.876
It disappears, right?

00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:51.216
disappears, right?

00:18:51.381 --> 00:19:02.381
No, no, you smiling made me rethink what I had to do. So, yeah, I think it'll disappear. Disappear, right? Yeah, so when you run the application again, you have an empty tree, right or wrong.

00:18:51.873 --> 00:18:57.873
See, now, now you smiling made me rethink what I had to do. So, yeah, I think it'll disappear.

00:18:58.832 --> 00:19:02.832
Yeah. You have an entity? Yeah.

00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:07.081
So… Are you sure it's right? Now you're convincing me!

00:19:03.188 --> 00:19:07.188
So… No, you're convincing me!

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:12.689
Right. Okay, that's really right. Okay, yes, you're right. Okay. So…

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.700
Great. Okay. Absolutely, okay. Okay.

00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:17.641
So, uh, so I need a wheel. Okay. To actually make sure the data persists.

00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:19.531
Uh, so I need a V, okay, to actually make sure the data persists. I don't lose it when I exit it.

00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:19.893
I don't lose it when I exit it.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.300
I need to… I containerize the whole, like, uh…

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.490
I need to, like, containerized recording, like, uh…

00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:26.488
Application? Yeah. So, actually,

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.640
Yeah. So actually…

00:19:27.258 --> 00:19:33.258
Even if you remove the container, or you rerun the container again, still you… the same problem, right?

00:19:27.727 --> 00:19:29.727
Even if you remove the container, yeah.

00:19:29.724 --> 00:19:31.724
When you read in the continuity,

00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:33.824
still the same problem.

00:19:34.468 --> 00:19:39.468
I need to make sure if I stop the application and run it again, I have the data store.

00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:39.796
I need to make sure… if I stop the application and run it again, I have the data stopped.

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:48.466
Or, if you are continuing the application, if I remove the container… But that's not where volumes come in, like… Yes, definitely. Yeah, that's where…

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.870
Or, if you are criticizing the application, if I remove the container?

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.750
But that's not where volumes come in. Yeah, that's…

00:19:48.723 --> 00:19:53.723
Now, Amat, what we have done is… Yeah, I've went away from Python. Yeah.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:55.868
Now, Amat, what you have done is… Yeah, I've went away from a pipe nerve. You actually gave the right answer. Yeah.

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:56.054
You actually give the right answer. Yeah.

00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:59.016
of an advanced topic, actually, right? Oh…

00:19:56.252 --> 00:19:59.252
Oh.

00:19:59.192 --> 00:20:05.192
I was not supposed to do that. Okay. Which means you understand the concept pretty well. Yeah.

00:19:59.745 --> 00:20:03.745
I was not supposed to do that.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.619
Which means you have to start the concept for you.

00:20:06.084 --> 00:20:11.084
Uh, what I'm trying to do is, uh, let's say you have no containers. Nothing yet.

00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:14.537
Uh, what I'm trying to do is, uh, let's say there are no containers or nothing, right? Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Okay. Actually, I will write this, uh, because, uh…

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:14.015
Okay, thanks for having me back to the sun.

00:20:16.963 --> 00:20:18.963
volume for persistency, so I don't forget for you. Yeah.

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.349
So I don't forget that.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:22.009
So I don't ask you again. Hmm.

00:20:20.564 --> 00:20:22.564
so I don't ask you again.

00:20:24.887 --> 00:20:32.887
So what… you want it to be synced. You want this? So, what I'll do… Just simply… Yeah.

00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:31.988
Okay, so… so what… you want it to be saved. You want this… so what I'll do, just simply right-click your semantic dictionary, right? Yeah.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:38.997
Uh, but if you exit then, it's not there anymore. Yeah. So, what can you use to make it permanent?

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:39.070
But if you exert them, it's not there anymore. Yeah. So, what can you use to make it permanent?

00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:50.368
Like, Gitav will make your heart be so strong PY. But actually, people… You mean the whole data itself. Uh, feedbacks, like a string. Yeah, the feedback. So, where should I store those strings, actually?

00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:48.218
You mentioned the whole data itself. Yeah, channel strings, right?

00:20:48.327 --> 00:20:50.327
So, where should I store those strings?

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:59.444
I guess it's in the dictionary, like, but dictionary got clear, so… if you push Python code, empty dictionary goes there, right? Yeah. The dictionary logic goes there, not the…

00:20:51.739 --> 00:20:54.739
Yes, it's a little shady, but make sure you get closer.

00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:59.569
If you push Python code, empty dictionary goes there, right? Yeah. The chain logic goes there, not the…

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:09.093
better doesn't go there, right? I'm now switching to GitHub, I'm trying to say, commit and stage it and all of those things, but… That is, that is your source code, right? Yeah. But, uh…

00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:09.516
I'm now switching to GitHub, I'm trying to say, commit and stage it and all of those things, but uh…

00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:11.199
For the code to be there,

00:21:09.331 --> 00:21:11.331
For the code to be there,

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:16.396
I'm trying to think… not for data. For the data to be there.

00:21:12.494 --> 00:21:16.494
I'm trying to think graphical data for the data to be there.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680
And it has nothing to do with grit up, let's say, like, if you're… Yeah.

00:21:17.973 --> 00:21:19.973
And it has nothing to do with the… Yeah.

00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:21.971
It has to do with Python itself?

00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:22.165
It has to do with Python itself?

00:21:22.604 --> 00:21:25.604
Python is running an application, Python is storing the data in a dictionary,

00:21:22.827 --> 00:21:25.827
Python is running an application, Python is storing the data in history.

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:29.251
But when you exit, it resets the data.

00:21:26.664 --> 00:21:29.664
But when you exit, it presets the data.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.663
When you redone it, there's nothing? Yeah. So, how can you…

00:21:30.003 --> 00:21:33.003
When you read them, there's nothing? Yeah. So, how can you…

00:21:32.923 --> 00:21:34.923
What can you do in Python?

00:21:33.078 --> 00:21:35.078
What can you do in Python?

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.830
So, before it exits, it doesn't forget the data, and when it runs again, it remembers the data.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So, before it exits, it doesn't forget the data, and when it runs again, it remembers the data.

00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:46.598
Can you use something thinking about the environment? I don't know if that… Yes, you can… just whatever is coming in your mind, just tell me.

00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:46.761
Can you use my own thinking about the environmental end of that? Yes, you can, just whatever's coming in.

00:21:46.658 --> 00:21:48.658
Think about… ah…

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.150
Think of a lot.

00:21:49.403 --> 00:21:51.403
Persistent driven for a minute.

00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:51.435
Persistent data, like permanent storage.

00:21:52.876 --> 00:22:02.876
I just saved the file, that's what… yeah, that's… I'm trying to overcomplicate things. I'm trying to go, yeah, I just saved the file. Yeah, that's, you know, I'm going in.

00:21:52.891 --> 00:22:02.891
I just see it defined. That's what you hear, that's… I'm trying to overcomplicate things. I'm trying to go… yeah, I just saved the fire. Yeah, that's… you know, I'm going…

00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:06.214
I'm overthinking it. Yes, you will save 25, right? And when you…

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:06.499
I'm overthinking this. When you…

00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:10.894
When you exit the application, file is still there. Yeah, the file is there. When you rerun the application, then…

00:22:07.272 --> 00:22:11.272
Are you feeling that privilege then?

00:22:11.172 --> 00:22:15.172
What will you do? I'll just load that file. Load that file, and load the dictionary, right? Yeah.

00:22:11.544 --> 00:22:15.544
What will you do? I'll just note that part. Yeah.

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:24.818
Sorry for overcomplicating. My mind went too far. I started to think about containerization, getting GitHub, which is you covered the hard ones. Yeah.

00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:19.339
Sorry for overcomplicating that, my mind went…

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.910
But I still have to think about containerization, getting data, which is you covered there.

00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:27.785
The question I haven't asked, I forgot to ask from anyone, right?

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.888
So, okay, so you say…

00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:30.234
So, okay, so…

00:22:30.254 --> 00:22:34.254
Which is good. Uh, but for example, let's say…

00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:34.676
Which is good, right? Uh, but for example, let's say…

00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:36.572
The feedback application. Mm-hmm.

00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:36.759
Uh, the feedback application? Mm-hmm.

00:22:37.343 --> 00:22:40.343
is, uh, actually…

00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:45.699
you have all of the things stored in file now, right? Yeah. The person, the user has to…

00:22:44.264 --> 00:22:46.264
The person that you would have to…

00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:48.355
has to actually, you know,

00:22:46.582 --> 00:22:48.582
It has to actually, you know…

00:22:49.482 --> 00:22:51.482
generate a report out of it.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.750
Uh, January 34 government.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.800
Or, uh, not even report, forget about the report also. The problem with filing is, for example, let's say,

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:59.307
The problem with tiniveness, for example, let's say the system, this system.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:07.340
The system, his system, he has a power outage issue at his home, he has used to that ignition at his home, right? And he's receiving feedback, and your Python application is right into a PI, right? Yeah.

00:22:59.697 --> 00:23:03.697
Yes, a power outage issue. ES restricted applicant, that is on, right?

00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:07.632
And he's receiving feedback, and your positive feedback. Yeah.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:10.789
But sometimes his computers shut down because of power outage.

00:23:08.107 --> 00:23:11.107
Sometimes, some people don't shut down.

00:23:11.898 --> 00:23:13.898
And half of the text is written to a file,

00:23:12.028 --> 00:23:14.028
And half of the text is written to a file.

00:23:14.439 --> 00:23:20.439
It is corrupt. Okay. Right? Is there any better solution than filing that makes sure the data is always

00:23:14.585 --> 00:23:16.585
It is corrupt. Okay.

00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:18.597
Is there any better solution than filing?

00:23:18.771 --> 00:23:20.771
That makes sure the data is always

00:23:20.557 --> 00:23:22.557
Uh, in a corrective state.

00:23:23.132 --> 00:23:31.132
I'm thinking, since you're saying that there is a power… Any other subject than filing, like filing? Yeah. Yeah, we'll file it. There is Getting GitHub.

00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:31.352
I'm thinking, since you're saying that there is… Yeah, we'll find it. There is Git and GitHub.

00:23:31.384 --> 00:23:36.384
So… Or source code management, right? Yeah, for source code. But you're talking about the data itself. Yeah. Right?

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:36.777
So… Yeah, full source code. But you're talking about the data itself, right?

00:23:36.702 --> 00:23:41.702
data. We are talking about the data itself, so… Another thing… yeah, you have studied it, by the way.

00:23:37.194 --> 00:23:40.194
you're talking about the data itself, so…

00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:42.201
that you have strictly weather.

00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:47.086
For two weeks. Is it Docker? You know, for two weeks you have storage? For 2 weeks, yeah.

00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:47.281
for two weeks ago. Is it Docker? For two weeks, yeah. For two weeks.

00:23:47.743 --> 00:23:53.743
when I have this notated. Uh, so we're going to Skola and what they gave us? Fatma al-Nohari.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.950
Uh, so we're going to…

00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:54.145
So, and they gave us a fuck?

00:23:53.738 --> 00:23:55.738
Told you what?

00:23:55.957 --> 00:24:00.957
Yeah, I took. We've studied about SQ.

00:23:56.235 --> 00:24:01.235
Yeah, I took… we studied about escape process.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.040
Database? Yeah, finding versus database, I remember, but uh… So why do we say versus? Because it's the other option. Yeah.

00:24:02.328 --> 00:24:08.328
So why do we say versus because it's another option. Yeah.

00:24:08.829 --> 00:24:11.829
So, I created a database using a

00:24:09.077 --> 00:24:12.077
So, I created a database using a…

00:24:12.425 --> 00:24:17.425
Doesn't matter, let's say you create your database. Okay. Like, when you create a database, where do you actually create a database? Where?

00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:17.105
It doesn't matter. Okay.

00:24:17.542 --> 00:24:22.542
Is database a server application, or…?

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.090
We are creating a database. Is database a server application, or…?

00:24:24.238 --> 00:24:31.238
Is database a server application? You have used Microsoft SQL, right? Yeah. So, is Microsoft SQL database server application or a client application?

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:29.714
That is Microsoft SQL, right? Yeah. So, is Microsoft SQL database?

00:24:29.665 --> 00:24:31.665
Thermo application recliner.

00:24:34.471 --> 00:24:36.471
So…

00:24:34.852 --> 00:24:36.852
So… that's okay.

00:24:40.089 --> 00:24:47.089
But it's a cell phone application, because you save the data there, and whenever the client needs something, it'll be, like,

00:24:40.424 --> 00:24:47.424
You can save the data there, and whenever the client needs something, it'll be, like,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320
push to them, get it.

00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:49.624
push to them.

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:52.358
Like, you read? Yeah…

00:24:50.717 --> 00:24:52.717
accurate? Yeah.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.740
So, who runs the QD, the server or the community?

00:24:52.802 --> 00:24:55.802
When you're… so, who runs the QT? The server or the client?

00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:58.621
the server. Uh, the server was the key?

00:24:56.984 --> 00:24:58.984
This is… quickly?

00:24:59.652 --> 00:25:01.652
Who gives the data back?

00:24:59.689 --> 00:25:01.689
And who gives the data back?

00:25:01.803 --> 00:25:06.803
No, no. That's, that's…

00:25:02.231 --> 00:25:09.231
No, no, the, yeah, it's the El Garcia. That's sort of measures. Okay.

00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:09.114
Okay, so…

00:25:09.277 --> 00:25:11.277
So, great.

00:25:09.843 --> 00:25:11.843
So, right, uh…

00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:13.286
server.

00:25:11.845 --> 00:25:13.845
server? What?

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.846
Oh, good. Okay, so…

00:25:15.216 --> 00:25:17.216
Okay, so, I think…

00:25:17.274 --> 00:25:26.274
When we are talking about client server, let's talk about client and servers, right? Okay, so what is the different… like, what is the difference between a client application and a server application?

00:25:17.305 --> 00:25:26.305
When we are talking about climate server, let's talk about Cloud Server, right? Okay, so what is the difference, like, what is the difference between a client application and a server application?

00:25:26.981 --> 00:25:36.981
The client gives requests, the server fulfills those requests. Ken, is it possible for the server to initiate a request and not the client? Is it possible?

00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:36.496
the client gives questions, the server fulfills those requests. Ken, is it possible for the server to initiate a request and not the client?

00:25:36.692 --> 00:25:38.692
Is it possible? Like, yes or no?

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:42.911
Like, yes or no? Is it possible for the server to send a request to a client?

00:25:39.847 --> 00:25:41.847
Is it possible for the server to…

00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:45.691
By nature, right? Like, by…

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.900
By nature, right? Like, by…

00:25:45.768 --> 00:25:47.768
Based on servers. Mm-hmm.

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:48.009
based on server's nature?

00:25:48.577 --> 00:25:50.577
Can it initiate a request to initiate, right?

00:25:48.622 --> 00:25:55.622
Can it initiate a request? Initiate, right? Initiate a request, let's say, a missing pile or something like this? No, not a request. Like, send a request to a client.

00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:55.776
initiate our course, let's say a missing file or something like this? No, because…

00:25:55.635 --> 00:25:57.635
Can server do that? Yes or no?

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.030
And so we're good to hear from you.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.620
Very simple. Yes?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Yes?

00:25:59.883 --> 00:26:04.883
Yes, okay. But not sure, yes. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah. So…

00:26:00.238 --> 00:26:03.238
Yes, okay. But not sure of this. That's the thing.

00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:05.437
Yeah. So…

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.863
Not as sure, yes. Yeah.

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:07.429
I'm not gonna show you something. Yeah.

00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:09.135
server.

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:09.539
a server?

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.670
I'm just… The server is used to store data, so I don't think…

00:26:13.037 --> 00:26:16.037
The server is used to store data, so I don't think…

00:26:17.074 --> 00:26:19.074
It's capable of sending requests.

00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:19.259
It's capable of sending requests.

00:26:19.999 --> 00:26:25.999
It receives requests and acts based on those requests. What about the hybrid applications?

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.180
Okay? It receives requests and acts based on those requests.

00:26:24.147 --> 00:26:26.147
What about the hybrid application?

00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:33.645
Hybrid applications such as, like, uh, let's say… I'm not calling it a server, not calling it a client itself. So it could be a notification, right?

00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:32.111
Hybrid applications such as, like, uh, let's say, I'm not calling it a server, I'm not calling it a…

00:26:32.204 --> 00:26:34.204
So it could be a notification, right?

00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:35.896
Because, like, for example… okay.

00:26:34.063 --> 00:26:36.063
He just, like…

00:26:36.004 --> 00:26:38.004
you're talking about webhooks. Yeah.

00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:38.251
Yeah, right?

00:26:37.978 --> 00:26:39.978
So, what is a webhook?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.360
So, what is a webhook?

00:26:41.113 --> 00:26:43.113
Uh…

00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:48.576
Okay, let's say you have a server application, right?

00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:48.856
Okay, actually, you have a server finish, thank you.

00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:54.405
You can actually add webhooks. Yeah. You can add webhooks, yeah. So…

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:54.607
you can actually add webhoops. Yeah. So, you can add webhooks, yeah. So…

00:26:55.277 --> 00:26:59.277
This adds capability to the server to send.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.500
This adds capability to server 2nd.

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:05.446
to send, like, requests, a request to another, uh, like, let's say GitHub and Docker.

00:27:00.777 --> 00:27:05.777
to send, like, requests, a request to another, uh, like, let's say GitHub and Docker.

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:08.133
Good. This is the…

00:27:06.214 --> 00:27:10.214
Yeah, this is the thing. Let's take example, right? Yeah.

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:10.333
So, yeah. Yeah.

00:27:10.377 --> 00:27:16.377
Yeah, so initiate requests. This time, right? So, it's not capable use it, right? Yeah. So in the moment's case.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.890
It's been shared requests.

00:27:13.782 --> 00:27:16.782
It's not capable easily, right?

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:20.067
certain capabilities, service is not capable of certain capabilities.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.830
It's not capable, server is not capable of sending requests, right? But…

00:27:20.298 --> 00:27:26.298
Because yes, again, I'd go back to the data, so… Okay. Okay, so I've removed it. Okay.

00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:23.641
If you asked again, I'd go back to the third time.

00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:26.595
Okay, thank you. Okay.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.050
You are right, like, service is not capable of sending requests, but…

00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:30.308
You are right, like, service, but…

00:27:30.443 --> 00:27:33.443
For example, if the server sends a request, does it…

00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:33.851
For example, if the server sends a request, does it…

00:27:34.597 --> 00:27:36.597
Staya Server, or something else, is the question, actually.

00:27:34.757 --> 00:27:36.757
steer server, it becomes a bit of separation.

00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:41.676
It doesn't… The server serves, right? Yeah, it serves. So…

00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:40.841
It doesn't… The server serves right click. Yeah,

00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:43.504
So, is it considered the hybrid?

00:27:41.596 --> 00:27:43.596
Let's considered the hybrid.

00:27:44.092 --> 00:27:46.092
Yep, yeah, yeah, hybrid, right?

00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:46.261
Yep. Yeah, yeah, okay, great.

00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:49.016
So, now, let's talk about WebEx. Okay.

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:49.212
So, now, let's talk about web apps. Okay.

00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:54.016
what are actually web?

00:27:53.022 --> 00:27:56.022
what are actually groups versus APIs?

00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:55.986
Uh, versus APIs.

00:27:56.498 --> 00:27:58.498
webhooks? What is APIs?

00:27:56.727 --> 00:28:01.727
Webhooks? So, when it comes to webhooks, let's say, for example,

00:27:59.009 --> 00:28:02.009
So, when it comes to webhooks, let's say, for example,

00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:03.591
We have, uh…

00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:04.007
We have, uh…

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.080
like, we containerized the whole project, and we have…

00:28:04.175 --> 00:28:10.175
like, we continually hunt projects, and we have, like… I mean, generally speaking.

00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:12.483
Like, generally speaking, forgot about categorizing, forget about the project.

00:28:10.812 --> 00:28:12.812
Forget about criticizing, forget about the project.

00:28:13.129 --> 00:28:18.129
Okay. What is an EPA endpoint?

00:28:13.164 --> 00:28:18.164
Just as, like, let's start with, is it… Okay. What is an API endpoint, right?

00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:20.981
APIs connecting to, like, let's say,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.170
APIs connecting to, like, let's say…

00:28:21.526 --> 00:28:24.526
applications together, yeah.

00:28:21.774 --> 00:28:24.774
applications together. Yeah.

00:28:24.498 --> 00:28:27.498
it could be an AI agent connected to a website,

00:28:25.047 --> 00:28:28.047
it could be an AI agent connected to a website,

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.990
or it's… It's a service client itself, like, when it comes to APIs.

00:28:31.671 --> 00:28:33.671
When it comes to… if it's a client connecting with someone.

00:28:31.962 --> 00:28:33.962
a client connecting with server.

00:28:34.202 --> 00:28:38.202
When it's APIs, or… it can be two servers connected together.

00:28:34.598 --> 00:28:38.598
It can be to surpass, connected together.

00:28:38.908 --> 00:28:41.908
Or can a server send a request? How can it connect? No, no.

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:42.245
Or can a service dentist, how can it, can you know?

00:28:42.742 --> 00:28:45.742
Yeah, coming back. So it's a client and a sub.

00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:45.806
Yeah, coming back. So, it's a client answer.

00:28:46.047 --> 00:28:48.047
Yeah, it's a client embassy.

00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:49.289
Yeah, yeah, it's a client in a CR. So, APIs, right? Yeah.

00:28:48.204 --> 00:28:54.204
So API, right? Yeah. So now, what is? Some people call it reverse APIs. Yeah, so…

00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:54.745
So now, what is webhooks? Some people call it reverse APIs, right? Yeah, so webhook…

00:28:54.772 --> 00:28:57.772
Webhook is, uh… it adds the ability…

00:28:55.456 --> 00:28:57.456
the… it adds the ability

00:28:58.757 --> 00:29:03.757
phrase it in a way that I don't go… You can't even give exemplars, right?

00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:03.765
to phrase it in a way that I don't go to… You know, people didn't give examples.

00:29:04.507 --> 00:29:08.507
The example that comes to mind is whenever I make a change in, like, for example,

00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:13.567
The example that comes to mind is whenever I make a change in, like, for example, for a code in GitHub, that's connected, then in Docker,

00:29:08.734 --> 00:29:10.734
for a code in GitHub.

00:29:11.214 --> 00:29:14.214
that's connect… then, uh, in Duka…

00:29:15.633 --> 00:29:21.633
It'll take those, uh, changes, it can implement them, it can pass or fail. I'm trying to…

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.050
it'll take those, uh…

00:29:18.068 --> 00:29:22.068
changes, it can implement them, it can pass or fail. I'm trying to…

00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:34.982
No, no, I understand. Yeah, I'm trying to phrase it in a way that's not overcomplicated. No, I understand. Yeah. So I got some idea, it's okay. Let's move to… because we haven't discussed it too much, but let's, uh, let's move, right? Okay, so, uh…

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:33.410
No, no, I… Yeah, I'm trying to phrase it in a way that's not overcomplicated. No question. So I want some ideas, okay? Let's move to… because we haven't discussed it too much, but let's, uh, let's move, right?

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:35.396
Okay, so, uh…

00:29:35.355 --> 00:29:38.355
You have seen this a lot of times, my mother, right? Like, uh…

00:29:35.472 --> 00:29:37.472
You have seen this a lot of times, right?

00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:41.867
like, uh, you've seen this underscore, underscore name.

00:29:39.638 --> 00:29:41.638
You have seen this underscore underscore name.

00:29:42.645 --> 00:29:44.645
Okay.

00:29:42.951 --> 00:29:44.951
Okay?

00:29:44.784 --> 00:29:46.784
equal to equal to underscond mean.

00:29:45.081 --> 00:29:47.081
equal to equal to underscore just to mean.

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:52.869
in many Python scripts, right? Okay, yeah. Do you remember anything over it? Like, what does it do if…

00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:53.076
invented by those good for you. Okay, yeah.

00:29:53.955 --> 00:30:01.955
Like, when is it true, when is it false? Let's say you have A.PY, having this, right? So, if I run A.PY, if I run A.PY,

00:29:54.621 --> 00:29:57.621
Like, when… when is it true? When is it false? Let's say you have A.P.

00:29:58.051 --> 00:30:01.051
Okay, having the spring. So, if I run D.P.

00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:04.566
Would this be true or false?

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:05.134
what does it be true or false?

00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:06.751
Can I just…

00:30:12.003 --> 00:30:15.003
Is this filing? Uh…

00:30:13.066 --> 00:30:15.066
Is this filing?

00:30:15.652 --> 00:30:19.652
No, no, this is just, uh, in the Python code, you might have seen this multiple times.

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:19.439
being able to just, uh, in the Python code, you might have seen this, but…

00:30:21.565 --> 00:30:27.565
We're just want to move, move. Your time is sharper. Sure, yeah. Almost we are out of the time. Okay, let's go to, uh…

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.970
We're just one time.

00:30:26.077 --> 00:30:28.077
So, let's go to, uh…

00:30:27.896 --> 00:30:29.896
Let's just go ahead.

00:30:28.291 --> 00:30:30.291
Let's just… oh, yeah.

00:30:30.773 --> 00:30:36.773
Uh, what is the difference between a public IP address? When we talk about client servers, right? Yeah. So…

00:30:31.113 --> 00:30:36.113
Uh, what is the difference between a public IP address? When we talk about client servers, yeah?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So, what is the relationship between a nuclear juice and a proton?

00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:39.859
What is the relationship between an IP address and the port?

00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:48.233
Public IP address? No, not public. IP address and port. Port is, like, the source itself, the IP address is, uh…

00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:44.201
public IP address? IP address and phone.

00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:48.598
Port is, like, the source itself, the IP address is, uh…

00:30:48.738 --> 00:30:50.738
Not the source? No, no, wait.

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:51.259
No, no, wait.

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:57.967
The IP address and the course forward, like, for, like, let's say…

00:30:53.337 --> 00:30:58.337
The IP address is also more like the… for, like, let's say…

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.660
I'm trying to…

00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:01.849
I'm trying to, uh…

00:31:08.886 --> 00:31:10.886
It was a sport.

00:31:11.484 --> 00:31:14.484
Sport to support… Okay, let's…

00:31:14.504 --> 00:31:16.504
Okay, let's take it this way. Yeah.

00:31:14.908 --> 00:31:20.908
Take it this way, right? Yeah. You have heard about public versus private educators, right? What is the difference between those?

00:31:16.798 --> 00:31:20.798
Uh, you have heard about public versus private network, right? What is the difference?

00:31:21.503 --> 00:31:23.503
Public is accessible to, like, let's say,

00:31:21.594 --> 00:31:23.594
public is accessible to, like, let's say…

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:30.149
It's accessible to everyone, and uh… why if it's not accessible. Okay, nice, nice, right? So now, uh…

00:31:24.284 --> 00:31:28.284
it's accessible to everyone, and the project's not accessible.

00:31:29.314 --> 00:31:33.314
So now, uh, let's say it's accessible. Okay.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:33.255
let's say it's accessible, okay, then…

00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:41.349
sometimes you see people often mention the point with IP address. Yeah. In case that two years, 188043, like, what does that do, specifically?

00:31:34.362 --> 00:31:41.362
Sometimes you see people also mention the port with the IP address. Yeah. What does that do? Yes, 880p443, like, what does that do specifically?

00:31:42.187 --> 00:31:44.187
When it goes to server, what does it do? What is the benefit of having it?

00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:44.454
When it goes to throw, what does it do? What is the benefit of having?

00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:46.695
apart. It's like…

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:49.591
It's, like, many people are connected, it's like…

00:31:47.586 --> 00:31:49.586
many people are connected, it's like…

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.920
How can I explain? Many people are connected, or…

00:31:50.234 --> 00:31:54.234
Many people are connected, or, uh…

00:31:54.786 --> 00:31:56.786
For example, uh…

00:31:55.027 --> 00:31:57.027
For example, uh…

00:31:58.307 --> 00:32:03.307
your server is running multiple applications. Yeah, it's running multiple applications. For each one, there is a unique…

00:31:58.613 --> 00:32:03.613
your server implementing multiple applications. Yeah, so running multiple applications. For each one, there's a…

00:32:04.018 --> 00:32:06.018
Poor port, yeah. Okay, is it possible for…

00:32:04.198 --> 00:32:06.198
Point, yeah. Is it possible for…

00:32:06.736 --> 00:32:13.736
two… two applications, more than one application, running on the same server, like, on the same machine, to have the same IP, have the same port.

00:32:06.956 --> 00:32:13.956
two… two applications, more than one application, running on the same server, like, on the same machine, to have the same IP, have the same code.

00:32:14.083 --> 00:32:16.083
have the same… yeah.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.420
have the same point.

00:32:17.295 --> 00:32:22.295
When it comes to IP, I think it's possible, but port, I'm not entirely sure. Yeah, yes or no?

00:32:17.577 --> 00:32:22.577
When it comes to IP, I think it's possible, but port, I'm not entirely sure.

00:32:22.593 --> 00:32:24.593
No. Like…

00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:27.871
No. Like, uh, sorry. So, you are saying that…

00:32:25.356 --> 00:32:28.356
Sorry, I forgot. So, you are saying that…

00:32:29.396 --> 00:32:32.396
two, uh, two different applications?

00:32:29.532 --> 00:32:32.532
two, uh, two different applications?

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.980
can have a…

00:32:34.156 --> 00:32:36.156
can… can have a…

00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:37.931
different, uh, it's gonna have the same code?

00:32:36.282 --> 00:32:38.282
different… I was gonna have the same thing?

00:32:39.578 --> 00:32:42.578
Two different applications on the same server. In the same server?

00:32:39.987 --> 00:32:42.987
Two different applications on the same server. On the same server?

00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:47.767
that have the same code or not? I… no, they don't have the same code. But a machine can have more than one IP address?

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:47.946
can have the same code or not? I… no, they don't have the same code, but a machine can have more than 20 pairs?

00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:53.226
Yeah, let's say, for example, when you have Ubunto, and you have, uh…

00:32:48.246 --> 00:32:51.246
Yeah, let's say, for example, when you have Ubunto,

00:32:51.468 --> 00:32:53.468
And, uh, you have, uh…

00:32:54.211 --> 00:32:56.211
like, it's a virtual machine,

00:32:54.286 --> 00:32:56.286
like, it's a virtual machine.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:33:06.474
But virtual machines, separate machine, yeah, but inside the virtual machine… yeah, that's… yeah, that's neatly different, yeah. But can… can a machine have more than one IP address as the… is a valid question.

00:32:57.204 --> 00:33:05.204
Yeah, but inside the virtual machine, yeah, that's it, yeah, that's completely different, yeah. But can… can a machine have more than one network?

00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:08.251
Yes, it's possible.

00:33:07.244 --> 00:33:13.244
Yes, it's possible. Because, see, like, it's a virtual machine, so the main, like,

00:33:08.357 --> 00:33:13.357
Yeah, because, see, like, it's a virtual machine, so the main, like,

00:33:13.595 --> 00:33:16.595
the… but it's virtual, right? Yeah.

00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:16.781
the… But usually it's commercial, right?

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.790
you think there are two IPs, but actually it's a virtually separate machine.

00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:20.986
You think there are two IPs, but actually it's a virtually separate machine.

00:33:21.496 --> 00:33:26.496
So, I handle when we were, like, taking Linux, like… Okay, you…

00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:24.176
So there's what I remember when I moved it, like…

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:26.719
taking Linux? Like, okay, you…

00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:28.767
You have a PC, right? Yeah.

00:33:27.053 --> 00:33:29.053
you have a piece of greed. Yeah.

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:32.424
Yeah, I just… do you have both Ethernet and Wi-Fi card?

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:32.714
Yeah, I just… Do you have both Ethernet and Wi-Fi card?

00:33:33.456 --> 00:33:35.456
Yes, the PC has, like… Yeah, so…

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.510
Yes, the PC has, like, VSO.

00:33:35.281 --> 00:33:37.281
I don't know, but…

00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:37.638
I don't know, but…

00:33:38.161 --> 00:33:41.161
If you try to connect both Ethernet and Wi-Fi together… Yeah.

00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:41.356
If you try to connect both Ethernet and Piper together, yeah,

00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:44.231
And do you have two different IP addresses, or same?

00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:44.599
And we have two different IP addresses, or same?

00:33:44.868 --> 00:33:46.868
It's the same, because it's coming from the same…

00:33:45.324 --> 00:33:47.324
It's the same, because it's coming from the same…

00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:53.381
No, no, only for that PC. For that PC, do we have two different IP addresses, or…? No, it's just the same, it's just, yeah, the same.

00:33:48.436 --> 00:33:53.436
No, no, only for that PC. For that PC, do we have two different IP addresses, or no, it's just the same, just the same.

00:33:53.607 --> 00:33:55.607
Right, so this is, uh…

00:33:54.227 --> 00:33:56.227
services, y'all…

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.001
if we call that… okay.

00:33:56.182 --> 00:33:58.182
Wait for that.

00:33:57.878 --> 00:33:59.878
So…

00:33:58.301 --> 00:34:00.301
So…

00:34:01.494 --> 00:34:03.494
Warm IP.

00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:05.826
per system, right?

00:34:06.647 --> 00:34:12.647
Okay, let's talk about quickly, let's jump to a few more things. Like, uh, for example…

00:34:06.997 --> 00:34:09.997
Okay, let's talk about completely, let's jump to, um…

00:34:10.468 --> 00:34:12.468
A few more things. Thank God.

00:34:13.772 --> 00:34:19.772
Docker? Okay, let's do first Git, right? Because we have been using a Git a lot, right? Yeah. So what is a…

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:18.118
Okay, let's do first look at, because we have been using a bit of a lot.

00:34:18.217 --> 00:34:20.217
So, what is a…

00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:25.571
Yeah.

00:34:25.546 --> 00:34:27.546
What is a version control system?

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:27.791
What does immersion performance say?

00:34:27.637 --> 00:34:36.637
Virgin Control System? Yeah, it's, uh… but Git… is Git a version control system, or is it something else? No, Git and GitHub are both function control systems.

00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:36.875
We'll just control system, yeah. It's, uh… is Git a virtual monitoring system, or is it something else? No, Git and GitHub are both function control systems.

00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.476
GitHub also? Like, uh…

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.720
Like, uh…

00:34:40.113 --> 00:34:43.113
Did you see it? No, uh…

00:34:40.519 --> 00:34:46.519
Do you see it? Okay, so I will try to see. No, no, uh, get is a version control system, okay? And GitHub is do… do what?

00:34:47.279 --> 00:34:52.279
It saves in a cloud, like… Oh, yeah. Uh…

00:34:47.495 --> 00:34:51.495
it saves in a cloud, like, yeah.

00:34:54.318 --> 00:34:56.318
like, uh, for example, if…

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.620
like, uh, for example, if…

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.560
more than one of… more than one team members, they are working on the same file. Yeah.

00:34:56.903 --> 00:35:00.903
More than one team members, they're working on the same file. Yeah.

00:35:00.586 --> 00:35:02.586
Right? And both of them…

00:35:00.787 --> 00:35:02.787
And both of them…

00:35:03.454 --> 00:35:06.454
are using… are on the same branch, main branch. Okay.

00:35:03.624 --> 00:35:06.624
are using, uh, are on the same branch you mean, right? Okay.

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:08.465
And, uh…

00:35:07.382 --> 00:35:09.382
And, uh, uh…

00:35:09.072 --> 00:35:12.072
If both of them push together. To the mean.

00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:14.551
to the me. So, the first person that pushed

00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:14.265
So, the first person that pushed

00:35:14.856 --> 00:35:16.856
That push is, like…

00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:16.897
That push, like, uh…

00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:23.705
Let's say he pushed A pushed first. Yeah, so the second person will face a conflict, then he will have to…

00:35:18.045 --> 00:35:24.045
Yeah. Yeah, so the second person will face a conflict, then he will have to…

00:35:23.906 --> 00:35:25.906
Like, get, uh…

00:35:24.195 --> 00:35:26.195
like, get, uh…

00:35:26.174 --> 00:35:36.174
do, like, get pulled, okay, to get, like, the newest update, because two people cannot push it to me at the same time. There'll be conflict. And then how do you solve conflicts, etc?

00:35:26.652 --> 00:35:33.652
to get, like, the newest update, because two people cannot push it at me at the same time.

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.865
And then, how do you solve it?

00:35:36.117 --> 00:35:40.117
How we solve conflicts? Uh, you just…

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.150
How you solve conflicts. You just literally speak and click.

00:35:41.128 --> 00:35:51.128
generally, the idea behind solving one flips. So… Yeah, we're speaking about getting… Do you see your change and his change both together? No, you see his change. His change, and… and also…

00:35:41.446 --> 00:35:43.446
Generally, the idea being sort of chips.

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:49.289
You were speaking about getting it. Obviously, your change has changed both together? No, you see his change.

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:55.447
And also, the addition changes that you can have settings? Yeah, it's there, but you'll have to…

00:35:51.244 --> 00:35:55.244
The additional change that you have is, like, receptors? Yeah, it's there, but you'll have…

00:35:55.758 --> 00:36:05.758
to pull, then you'll have to commit once again. Yes, but when we pull, yeah, for example, then I can see his change, of course, right? Yeah, yeah. But I… can I also see my change? The new change? No, it's not there.

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:58.779
to pull, then you'll have to commit once again.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:06.160
Yeah, yeah. But I… can I also see my change? The new change? No, it's all good.

00:36:06.016 --> 00:36:08.016
Okay, so…

00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:11.879
So, but then you have to go and you come back to merging. Yeah.

00:36:08.652 --> 00:36:11.652
But then you have to do a new commit to merge, and resolve the container, right?

00:36:12.402 --> 00:36:14.402
So…

00:36:16.835 --> 00:36:18.835
Okay, next week we'll talk about, like, uh…

00:36:17.249 --> 00:36:19.249
Should we talk about, like, uh…

00:36:19.153 --> 00:36:25.153
two or three questions remaining quickly. I'll do it. Just like, just like you have…

00:36:19.698 --> 00:36:24.698
two or three questions. Just like, just like…

00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:26.781
You've got the concept of…

00:36:25.637 --> 00:36:29.637
The concept of branch or staging area, commit, and get, right? Let's not talk about that.

00:36:30.332 --> 00:36:36.332
Uh, when you talk about Docker, you have the concept of a Docker file, image, and a container, right? Yes, so how do they relate to each other?

00:36:30.477 --> 00:36:36.477
So, how do you relate to each other?

00:36:36.777 --> 00:36:41.777
So you start with the Dockerfile, like, whenever you record… there's a code, Python will…

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:41.859
So you're stuck in the docket fire, like, whenever you record… there's a code, Python…

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:47.110
Could you… like, add the Dockerfile, then you'll have, uh…

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.440
Could you want… you, like, add the Dockerfile?

00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:47.525
then you'll have, uh…

00:36:48.243 --> 00:36:53.243
like, uh, in Docker, like, you create an image, which is…

00:36:48.633 --> 00:36:54.633
like, in Docker, like, you create an image, which is a blueprint.

00:36:54.088 --> 00:36:58.088
a blueprint. It has all the, like, let's say, for example, the Python

00:36:55.581 --> 00:36:58.581
It has all the, like, let's say, for example, the Python

00:36:58.712 --> 00:37:02.712
all of the things needed, the dependencies, the Python, uh… Yes.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.950
all of the things needed, the dependencies, the Python, uh…

00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:05.126
what's that called? The…

00:37:03.243 --> 00:37:05.243
What's that called? We…

00:37:05.488 --> 00:37:08.488
The Virgin, all of those things, and uh…

00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:08.817
The version of those things, and uh…

00:37:09.446 --> 00:37:11.446
Yeah. And then what is the content?

00:37:09.449 --> 00:37:11.449
Yeah, and then what is the container, then?

00:37:11.672 --> 00:37:13.672
The container is the project itself.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.850
The container is the project itself.

00:37:13.838 --> 00:37:18.838
So, can I… can I run more than one… so I can run a container based on the image, right?

00:37:14.006 --> 00:37:19.006
So, can I… can another important one… so I can run a tentatively based on the image, right?

00:37:20.157 --> 00:37:23.157
double run, and I need to give the image to run the… The image is a necessity.

00:37:20.459 --> 00:37:23.459
The image isn't necessary.

00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:28.576
Can I run more than one container for the same image? Yeah, you can do that. You can do that, right? Yeah.

00:37:24.851 --> 00:37:27.851
Can I run more than one containers? Yeah, you can do that.

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.119
Yeah. So…

00:37:28.689 --> 00:37:30.689
So…

00:37:32.214 --> 00:37:34.214
Okay, can I…

00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:34.704
Okay, can I…

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:36.775
Uh, can it run?

00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:36.792
Uh, can it run?

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:41.019
two containers from the same image on the same ports.

00:37:37.373 --> 00:37:41.373
two containers from the same image on the same ports.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.330
external ports. We're going back to ports.

00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:45.541
We're going back to politics.

00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:51.326
Like, for example, when you run the Docker container, you mentioned ports, right? Yeah. Left-hand side, right-hand side. Do different containers?

00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:51.651
So, like, for example, when you run the program, did you mention portrait? Yeah. Left and side, right? Two different containers?

00:37:52.164 --> 00:37:56.164
Yeah. For example, let's say we're talking about, yeah, two different containers.

00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:56.486
Yeah, for example, let's say we're talking about, yeah, two different containers.

00:37:56.278 --> 00:38:00.278
Same image, let's say image 1 is here, right? Okay.

00:37:56.538 --> 00:37:58.538
Same image, you know, see it.

00:37:58.405 --> 00:38:00.405
image, one is… Fuck yeah.

00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:02.667
And I'm running…

00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:02.902
And I'm running…

00:38:03.304 --> 00:38:05.304
two containers, Docker run, Docker run.

00:38:03.685 --> 00:38:05.685
two containers, Docker and Docker.

00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:10.535
Two different containers. Yes, dash P here, let's say, because both are…

00:38:06.387 --> 00:38:09.387
Two different sessions. Yeah, Stash P here, let's see.

00:38:09.448 --> 00:38:11.448
Because Utah.

00:38:12.002 --> 00:38:18.002
I will do 8080 here, and inside, let's say, this is, uh, let's say this is 8888.

00:38:12.118 --> 00:38:18.118
I will do 8080 here, and inside, let's say, this is, uh, let's say this is 8888.

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:24.863
And inside, this is 9999F, right? Like, wait a minute, these are both same. Okay.

00:38:18.978 --> 00:38:20.978
So, this is… 9, 9.

00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:25.323
These are both the same. Okay.

00:38:25.096 --> 00:38:27.096
these both are different, so…

00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:29.291
these boots are different. So, just take a look at it, take your time.

00:38:27.082 --> 00:38:29.082
Just take a look at it, take your time.

00:38:29.063 --> 00:38:31.063
And is it possible or not?

00:38:29.399 --> 00:38:31.399
And is it possible or not?

00:38:34.006 --> 00:38:44.006
One image for two… Someone? Trick someone tell you I asked this question? No, uh, actually, no, sorry, but I phased, actually. No one told me about it. They spoke about a few things, but no, this one.

00:38:34.402 --> 00:38:40.402
One image for two different… Someone tell me I asked this question. No, uh, actually, no, but I didn't mean it actually…

00:38:41.408 --> 00:38:44.408
No one tells me about this. They spoke about a few things, but not the same.

00:38:44.944 --> 00:38:46.944
Uh… no, no, just take a look at it.

00:38:45.276 --> 00:38:47.276
Uh… no, no, just take a look at it.

00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:50.766
take… take out some time, just a few seconds, right? And…

00:38:48.235 --> 00:38:50.235
Take out some time, just a few seconds, right?

00:38:50.966 --> 00:38:55.966
You know my concern is not if it's possible or not.

00:38:51.565 --> 00:39:04.565
You know, my concern is not if it's possible or not, but if there is one image for two different containers, not the same container, right? Is it within the same container, or two different… No, no, two different containers from the same image.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.570
But if there is one image for two different containers, not the same container, right?

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:04.938
Is it within the same container, or two different containers? No, two different containers from the same image.

00:39:04.584 --> 00:39:11.584
From running Docker Run commands two times. Okay, so are we using command, you give the name of the iterator? Yeah, yeah. If I'm running two times.

00:39:05.864 --> 00:39:11.864
Okay, so are we using… you give the name of the address? Yes, yeah. I'm doing it two times.

00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:18.018
Let's say you have two CMDs, right? So Docker and Docker and same image. Yeah. But ports are like this, so…

00:39:12.072 --> 00:39:14.072
let's say you have two… Yeah.

00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:16.059
Docker and Docker and same imagery. Yeah.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.320
But groups are like this. So, uh, left-hand side port is same, right-hand sideboard is different. Yeah, so it's possible.

00:39:19.147 --> 00:39:22.147
Uh, left-hand checkport is same, right-hand checkport is different. Yeah, so it's possible.

00:39:22.223 --> 00:39:24.223
Yeah, right? So…

00:39:22.353 --> 00:39:24.353
Yeah. Alright, so…

00:39:26.707 --> 00:39:35.707
my mind went away to the call Compose and all of those things, because speaking about two different containers, that's what came to mind, so… That's right. Okay, so…

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.460
my mind went over to Doc Compose and all of those things, because…

00:39:30.644 --> 00:39:33.644
Speaking about two different containers, that's what came to my concern.

00:39:36.603 --> 00:39:38.603
Do you see any benefit of having a CICD pipeline?

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.670
Do you see any benefit of having a CICT pipeline?

00:39:39.678 --> 00:39:45.678
Yeah. What do you think is the benefit of it? So, when it comes to CI-CD, it's like, for automation.

00:39:39.975 --> 00:39:45.975
Yeah, uh, what do you think is the benefit? So, when it comes to CIECD, it's like, for automation.

00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:47.767
Yeah, like, automating projects.

00:39:46.076 --> 00:39:48.076
Yep, like, automating projects.

00:39:48.117 --> 00:39:50.117
that's the main goal of them.

00:39:48.427 --> 00:39:50.427
that's the main goal of them.

00:39:50.258 --> 00:39:55.258
And, uh, also, CICD. What is the benefit of automation? What do we…

00:39:50.577 --> 00:39:55.577
And, uh, also CICD. What is the benefit of our commission? What do we…

00:39:56.098 --> 00:40:03.098
You don't actually need, like, lots of coding for that. Lots of commands, maybe? Yeah, no lots of commands, it'll just, like, automate

00:39:56.582 --> 00:40:02.582
You don't need, like, lots of coding for that. Lots of commands? Yeah, no lots of commands, it'll just, like,

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.670
automate everything.

00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:07.821
We have everything, yeah. Okay, nice, nice split, right? Yeah. Last thing. Yeah?

00:40:06.015 --> 00:40:08.015
Yeah. Last time. Yeah?

00:40:08.142 --> 00:40:16.142
just… Okay, just one final agency. Yeah. Uh, how does a large language model…

00:40:08.587 --> 00:40:18.587
Just, uh, 2 minutes later. Okay. Just one final thing. AI agents, right? Yeah. Uh, what… how does a large language model is different from an AI agent, right? Like, uh…

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.220
is different from any agent.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.040
that you have any ideas? Yeah.

00:40:19.064 --> 00:40:23.064
You have ChatGPT, and then you have an AI agent, right? Yeah. Uh, what is…

00:40:22.373 --> 00:40:26.373
Uh, what is that thing that any agent can do that LLM cannot do?

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.090
that thing that EA agent can do, that LLM cannot.

00:40:28.483 --> 00:40:31.483
Repetitive tasks, like, uh…

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:32.679
repetitive tasks, like, uh… or my…

00:40:32.712 --> 00:40:35.712
Yeah, you can, like, uh…

00:40:33.942 --> 00:40:35.942
Yeah, you can, like, uh…

00:40:37.597 --> 00:40:39.597
Can I say…

00:40:42.783 --> 00:40:44.783
So, LLM versus AI agents.

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:44.839
So, LLM versus AI agents here.

00:40:44.843 --> 00:40:46.843
AI agents can do everything.

00:40:45.023 --> 00:40:47.023
AI agents can do everything.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:48.830
That's, like, uh…

00:40:47.004 --> 00:40:49.004
That's, like, uh…

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.520
Can they… can they make any pay equal?

00:40:49.723 --> 00:40:51.723
Can they… can they make any recall?

00:40:52.212 --> 00:40:55.212
It's just… no. Can they…

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:58.579
He said, no. Can they… They can generate how, like, how you can do it.

00:40:55.741 --> 00:40:58.741
They can generate how, like, how you can do it.

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:07.276
But they cannot do it. Nice. Okay, thank you, Hamil. Thanks, sir. I appreciate it. Should I leave the meeting? Yeah, sure, just stop the recording. I will save the transcript.

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:04.559
But they cannot do it. Okay, thank you, Emma. Thanks, Emma, I appreciate it. Should I leave the meeting? Yeah, sure.
