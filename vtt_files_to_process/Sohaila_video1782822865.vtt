00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:05.743
So, uh, okay, so yeah, uh…

00:00:04.063 --> 00:00:06.063
So, uh, so…

00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:07.907
This is actually just, uh…

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.230
This is actually just, uh…

00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:11.577
Um, you can think of it as, uh…

00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:15.351
the small one with the big one, kind of, but we will actually combine it.

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.788
a smaller one with the big one, kind of, but we don't actually combine it.

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:17.775
So…

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.209
So…

00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:26.237
Python Basics, advanced Python, network basics, you have a Linux basics, Git Basics, Docker basics.

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:22.187
Python B6, I want to network B6.

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:26.693
basics, proper basics.

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:32.088
deployment, some things about… small things about AI agents, since we have done much

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:32.246
Some things, small things about the agents, since we haven't done much

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.612
We haven't done much, right? So, let's a start, right? I'm going to…

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
We haven't done much right. So, let's just start, right?

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.825
Sometimes, you know, when we are playing games,

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.347
Sometimes, you know, when we are playing teams,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:45.924
Yeah. So, uh, we actually keep sending backwards, packets, packets, packets, but sometimes there's something missing.

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:46.038
Yep. So, we actually keep sending packets, packets, packets, packets, but sometimes there's something missing.

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:48.387
So, uh…

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:48.447
So, uh…

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:50.369
the server actually doesn't care.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.634
The server ownership doesn't care.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:57.017
It doesn't wait for the acknowledgement, and it just… so that we lagged, actually. But then, if other tickets are coming up, so…

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.170
It doesn't fit for the acknowledgement, and it just… so that reliability.

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:57.374
But then, if other tickets are coming up soon.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:03.016
Uh, we see the game as non-smo. So, for example, whenever we play a game and it lags, right?

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
Um, we see that he was not sold. So, for example, when we play a game, it lags, right?

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.629
So it means the packets are not being transmitted to the server.

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:07.755
So, it means the packets are not being transmitted to the server.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.790
for some reason, we don't know, but actually the packets go missing, for example.

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.179
For some reason, we don't know, but actually the packet is still missing, for example.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.259
Yeah. Here's a scenario.

00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:18.527
You have numbers, right? Now, numbers will always be

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:18.871
You have no more straight. The numbers will always be…

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.793
From 1 to 10. Alright.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.316
from 1 to 10. Alright.

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:25.946
And no number will repeat. It's not more than 10, it's not plus than…

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:28.213
no number will repeat. It's not more than 10, it's not plus than 1, right? It's always 1 to 10, right?

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:28.273
One, right?

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:30.964
But there's one number missing.

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.374
Yes, you can tell, right? But how would Python tell?

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:34.687
Four.

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.934
So, for example, yeah, for example, this list…

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:38.338
So, for example. Oh, okay. For example, this, this…

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.190
is going to go as an input, right? To your Python application. Don't worry about syntax or anything. Okay. What would be your logic?

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:40.434
is going to go as an input, right?

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:45.537
to your Python application. Don't worry about syntax or anything. Okay. What would be your logic?

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.931
to find the missing number.

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.201
To find the missing number.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Maybe…

00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:55.813
Can I just say, Diane? Say it also? Yes, you can see it first. Yeah. Like, uh, the difference between each number is 1.

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:56.223
Can I just say, Diane? Yeah, like, uh, the difference between each number is one.

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:58.922
Yeah, one of them will be two.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.239
But, yeah, one of them will be to…

00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:03.368
Yeah, and it's ran for… it's 3 and 5.

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:06.507
Uh, yes, like, for example, if 80x23… Yeah, 3 and 5, I will get minus 2, which you can convert to positive, it's 2, right?

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:06.053
Again, fight the admitted many students to convert.

00:02:06.907 --> 00:02:09.907
Yeah. Which is a very nice approach, right?

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.002
Yeah.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.279
Unless… But, mister, like, like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.640
Unless… But, Mr., like, like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9?

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:20.164
So, like, the next one… the next one will also be nice, so it will be 1 to 9 with the 4.

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.175
So, like, the next one will also be nice, so it will be…

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.606
No, no, see, for example, you start here, right?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.800
No, no, see, for example, you start here, right? Yeah. So, for example, first you compare these two numbers. Yeah.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:28.336
So, for example, first you compare these two numbers, right? Then you compare these two, then you keep going forward.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:32.835
So, of course, one… one… here you will spot…

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:32.741
So, of course, one area you will spot

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.769
Yeah. So you know that which number is missing, right? Yes. This is a good logic, but…

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:38.149
Yep. So you mean to put your emergency room? Yes, the emergency, but…

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.117
Now, the numbers are still promote.

00:02:39.374 --> 00:02:44.374
Now, the numbers are still from 1 to 10. Okay.

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:44.402
So over 2 is 0, 7 is 0.

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:47.737
And it's here, Su5 is here…

00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:47.911
5 to 2…

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:51.046
Eat soon…

00:02:51.262 --> 00:02:53.262
What is… one is… well…

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300
1? 9?

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.851
9… and… 6…

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:56.154
Six.

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:57.963
Thanks. So, Erin?

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:00.127
transmissible.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:01.142
1, 2, 3, 3 is missing, so that's right at 3.

00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:04.721
What's missing?

00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:05.061
So what is it missing?

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:07.924
Oh, sorry, where's the missing one, right? Now…

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:07.202
Yeah.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
Now, the same thing, but it's not sorted.

00:03:09.444 --> 00:03:12.444
Now, the same thing, but it's not sorted.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.419
Yeah. So…

00:03:12.988 --> 00:03:15.988
Yeah. So, now what would be all logic to find missing number?

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.662
Now, what we're logging the financing.

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.583
Find them, sing from them. But it's always from 1 to 10, you know.

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:22.007
But it's always someone to tell you.

00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.744
Numbers are from 1 to 10.

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:27.194
The push arts from 1 to 10, although they're shuffle, right? Yeah. There's one missing, so how…

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:27.157
Although they're shuffled, right? There's one missing, so how would you…

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:37.363
Uh, I have something, but I don't know if it's, like… imaginary, or, like…

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.870
Uh, I have something, but I don't know if it's, like, imaginary, or, like…

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:40.438
You can tell. What's your… Like, the total of that?

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:40.658
Like, the total of depths?

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.514
It always will be the same.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.875
is always would be the same.

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:45.737
No, no, you're right, you're right. Yeah.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:48.482
Like, for example, again, let's say you have to believe.

00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:48.443
Danny. Okay, let's say you have triple available.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:55.059
Yeah. One of the sake of simplicity? Imagine you have…

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.425
Yeah. For the sake of some…

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.047
Imagine if… 43.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.277
Like, 1, 2, 3, like, for example.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:59.246
Yes, very simple.

00:03:57.384 --> 00:03:59.384
1, 2, 3.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.799
This is the total. If you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right? So let's say this…

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:05.434
This is the total. If you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… Okay.

00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:08.095
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 15, I think? 5,

00:04:06.398 --> 00:04:08.398
5 is 15? 5 to 7.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:11.176
Alright, we can… we can very calculate the sum.

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.295
I can go to the peninsula.

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.729
I can go to the calculator.

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:17.113
Maybe let's go for accuracy, right? Let's, uh…

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.321
Maybe in that school food decoration, right? Okay. Let's go.

00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:19.797
Open up the literature, and I will just…

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.620
some, all of them, right? So, for example,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.930
8765…

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:35.833
55 years. 55, yes. How long do you know, right? Let's say you total me.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
55. What do you know, right? Let's…

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.750
How will you find them in the second? Yeah. Uh, let's…

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.779
Now, how will you find this? Yeah.

00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.521
Uh, I let… I let it, uh…

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.821
take the…

00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:43.602
take the…

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:46.094
Yeah, some of the oiler for that.

00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:46.127
So, yeah, some of the oiler for them.

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:49.922
And then 55 minus the sum that it gets.

00:04:46.927 --> 00:04:49.927
And then 55 minus the sum that it gets.

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:52.536
will be the number that was set. Very nice.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.567
will be the number that we see. Very nice.

00:04:52.632 --> 00:04:54.632
Nice.

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.109
Nice.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.819
This is… this is very good.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:59.413
This is… this is very good. All right.

00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:02.982
Just one last.

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.344
Just one last.

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:07.595
Um, let's… or consider the same.

00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:07.943
Um, let's… or consider the same.

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:09.754
All right. Let's error, right?

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:10.104
All right.

00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:18.703
But numbers can be different, but right now, let's say, just assume the numbers are the same, but can be different, right? Now, it's not about the missing one, right? You have to find the maximum number.

00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:18.882
But numbers can be different, but right now, let's say, discussing the numbers are safe, it can be different, right? Okay. Now, let's talk about the missing one, right? You have to form the maximum number.

00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:21.496
Uh, in the list.

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:21.782
Uh, nope.

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:25.404
the maximum number in the list. And I don't know that this one for today.

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:25.678
the maximum. And I didn't know that this one for today.

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:29.276
There can be any numbers. There'll be any number? Just the maximum one.

00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:29.385
Can I be any number?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.360
the most maximum number. You have to find that one.

00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:31.618
most flexible.

00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:33.842
You have to find them. Uh…

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:37.596
Uh… I forgot what we wrote exactly in the code AI.

00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:37.961
I forgot what we wrote exactly in the code, Yanni.

00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:42.591
Now I should just tell you a logic like you told the logic here, right? Just like, you know, maximum, minimum.

00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:41.143
the logic here, right?

00:05:41.158 --> 00:05:43.158
Nos, like, nos maximum minimum, right?

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.939
Just mixing. Okay. Yeah.

00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:46.118
Just Smith. Okay.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.667
You just need to find the maximum number from here. Numbers can be any.

00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:01.993
I'm not sure, I just… I just don't want to say something wrong.

00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:03.301
I'm not sure, I just… I just don't want to say something. Bro, this is the… this is the difficult one.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:04.062
This is the difficult one.

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.969
The one I give you now is the easiest one, which means you already have done it before.

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:07.705
But when I give you an artist, which means you already have done it.

00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:10.913
This one?

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.417
This one? Uh, the other ones are not…

00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:14.263
Those are… no. This one you haven't done before? Ever? No, this one.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.550
Those are… no. No, this one?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.640
You haven't done with the total, minus something? No, it's something related to coining.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.889
I noticed something related to coding.

00:06:18.758 --> 00:06:22.758
But you have done it, something like that. Uh, no.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.069
But you have been something like… Uh, no, um…

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:28.476
No, but I know, right? Because there was a question I, like…

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:28.709
I'll tell you later, I don't want it to be here. There was a question, like…

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:31.816
Uh, about Brits, and there's one king and…

00:06:29.137 --> 00:06:35.137
footprints, and there's one king, and… So you have done it right, yeah. Not as coding, you know.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
you know…

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.661
Not as coding as which one is the missing bracket.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:37.329
As, uh, which one is the missing bread?

00:06:38.118 --> 00:06:43.118
Yes. But unfortunately, in the interview… Unfortunately. In the interview, that will not help.

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:42.595
Yeah. Unfortunately.

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:48.895
that will not happen. No. No, but I did it by myself, and…

00:06:43.564 --> 00:06:48.564
Absolutely. No, but I did it by myself at the end. No, the visualization is very good, right?

00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:56.761
That will not help, because I will identify as soon as I… as you tell me the solution, I know you have done it previously, you're not sure. Now you have to.

00:06:49.064 --> 00:06:57.064
That will not help, because I will identify as soon as I… as you tell me the solution, I know if you have directly. Oh, okay.

00:06:57.582 --> 00:07:02.582
I think it makes sense. But I was surprised of this question, I didn't talk that. Not necessarily, I was amused.

00:06:57.763 --> 00:07:02.763
But I was surprised of this question. I didn't thought that it was really clear.

00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:09.692
So now we are disappointed. And if you… if you would answer this, I would totally look up, right?

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:09.736
So now we are disappointed. This, I totally love it.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.980
This one? This one, right? Just find the maximum.

00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:13.301
This one? This one, right? This one at the beginning.

00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:15.103
Elementary.

00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:17.347
How would you do it?

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.675
Anything, like… Can we compare, like, Python?

00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:26.122
Can we compare, like, from…

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:30.357
Yeah, this is what I… yeah, this is what I did there.

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:30.499
ThinkLogic like you… Yeah, this is what I did there. Yeah.

00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:32.754
But, I mean, can we compare, like, region?

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.139
What, I mean, can we compare, like, each?

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:36.095
indexes like this, yeah? Okay, let's say you can compare, right, then.

00:07:33.592 --> 00:07:35.592
indexes like this, Yanni. Okay, let's see…

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:38.609
You can compare then. You can do anything you like.

00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.121
you could… you can do anything, right?

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:44.566
Just don't use the built-in minimum accident, don't use the built-in, right? You cannot use the built-in, but…

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:44.839
Okay, like, if we… Yeah, we cannot.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.542
Uh, you have to write your own logic.

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.833
Uh, you have to write it on the budget.

00:07:47.082 --> 00:07:49.082
Uh, you can even scan it.

00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:52.221
Um, you can… you can scan all of the numbers, right? Yeah. And figure out the maximum, but how would you do it?

00:07:49.527 --> 00:07:52.527
Figure out the maximum, but how would you do it?

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:56.923
Because you did it by yourself, right? So, with…

00:07:55.316 --> 00:07:57.316
Because you did it by yourself, right? Yeah.

00:07:57.567 --> 00:08:00.567
You just need time, and you can do it also yourself. So I can take my time.

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:00.827
You just need time, and you can do it on Zoom. So I can take my time.

00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.173
Yeah, sure. I see. Sometimes.

00:08:03.263 --> 00:08:05.263
Think about it.

00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:28.272
And we cannot use the maximum answer. But if you need hint, I can give you a hint. Okay, let's…

00:08:23.742 --> 00:08:25.742
And you cannot use the maximum answer.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600
Okay, what's it?

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:30.567
You can assume both.

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:30.988
You can assume…

00:08:30.546 --> 00:08:32.546
You can make assumptions, etc.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:32.955
You can make assumptions.

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:37.189
That we have used this. Now, I want to say something. Like, for example, you can assume that

00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:37.741
that we have used this. Now, I want to say something…

00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:39.327
The first number is the maximum.

00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:40.001
forced to look at that difference.

00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:46.072
As you can just… Okay, if the first one is the maximum.

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:48.198
Assume, just assume, right? And then write your logic. The first one is the maximum, so we can divide each index.

00:08:46.372 --> 00:08:50.372
So we can divide each index by the first one.

00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:51.707
By the first one, and the one that gets us one.

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:53.828
And the one that gets us one will be the one, uh…

00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:53.749
will be somewhat, uh…

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:59.049
I don't understand. Dividing index means, like, for example, let's assume… you assume 2 is the maximum, right?

00:08:57.689 --> 00:09:01.689
let's assume, because the maximum, right? Yeah, like, for example, F2.

00:08:59.216 --> 00:09:01.216
Yeah, for example, hopefully…

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.450
Yeah. If 2 is the maximum.

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:04.398
Yeah. If 2 is the maximum.

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:13.597
Divided by 2, it will get us 1. So the one that get was 1, that will be the maximum, but for all of them, it will give us, like,

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:09.633
divided by 2, it will get else 1. So, the one that get was 1.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:13.758
It will be the maximum, but for all of them, it will give us, like…

00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:20.628
0. Okay, let's say… assume this is the maximum, right? Now you have two. So you divide it by 2, you get 1.

00:09:13.912 --> 00:09:15.912
0.02.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.050
So you divide it by 2, that's 1.

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:23.792
Then you move to the next number. Ah, it will not get one.

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:24.149
No, it will not get one.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.560
Yeah, if you divide 7 by 2…

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:26.615
Yeah. It'll be less.

00:09:26.763 --> 00:09:30.763
Yes, if you divide 7, uh, by… Actually, 7 is adding…

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.899
Actually, Stephan, is there any…

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:37.804
more… you get more, like… For example, like… 3.5, right? Oh, sorry, 3, 1, and 2.

00:09:31.235 --> 00:09:35.235
For example, like, 1, 2, 1, 3.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.980
Uh, sorry, 3, 1, and 2.

00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:39.967
let's assume this is the maximum.

00:09:38.173 --> 00:09:51.173
Let's assume this is the maximum. No, but maximum can also appear here, in between. But you… oh, okay, the assumption, I thought that we already know that this is… No, assuming, like, assuming doesn't mean it's the actual maximum, right? Okay, okay. Just assuming, right?

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:43.264
No, the maximum can also appear here in between

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:47.282
But you… oh, okay, the assumption, I thought that we already know that this is the…

00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:51.212
Um… Okay, okay.

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:53.592
So you didn't bring the rotation.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:57.030
So you can build your logic. No, but this is what I… I just thought that I already know that this one is

00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.481
No, but this is what I thought. I just thought that I already know that this one is

00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:59.539
One more, one more, Henry. Can you…

00:09:57.816 --> 00:09:59.816
Can you…

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:01.661
use comparison, actually.

00:10:00.106 --> 00:10:02.106
use comparison intriguing.

00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:08.849
Assume and compare, like, can you… Yeah, is it a comparison, yeah, like, between all of them, and the one that has…

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:09.290
a Zoom and computer. Yeah, I thought of comparison, Yanni, like, between all of them, and the one that has

00:10:09.638 --> 00:10:15.638
the biggest… Okay, okay, let's say… let's say I will help you out, right? So, you compare 2 with 7.

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:14.237
the biggest, you know,

00:10:14.229 --> 00:10:16.229
compared to Bitcoin.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:21.032
Okay, let's assume 2 is the maximum, right? Assume 2 is the maximum. Assume.

00:10:17.152 --> 00:10:19.152
For, um… Okay, let's just choose the team.

00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:21.393
As you twist the next one. Assume.

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:23.253
Because you have to assume, right? No, right.

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:23.586
Okay. No, no.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:26.314
Now come… you have to compare 2 with 2.

00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:26.705
Now come… you have to compare two with two.

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:28.796
Oh, equal, don't worry about it.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:30.834
Okay. Compare 2 with 7.

00:10:28.783 --> 00:10:30.783
Uh, compared 2 with 7.

00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:33.188
Uh, like, compare means…

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.360
uh, like, compare means.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.879
greater than or less than right? Yeah. S2…

00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:36.315
Due to the non-resistant, right? Yeah. It's two…

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:39.375
Because maximum should never be less than anything, right?

00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:39.821
Because maximum should never be less than anything, right?

00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:52.749
Oh, yeah, yeah. So, it cannot be less than anything. So, for example, if you assume 2… Oh, okay, okay. No. So, when you will compare it, it will not get a minus. Uh, like, true or false, let's say, right? Less than.

00:10:40.403 --> 00:10:42.403
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Uh-huh.

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:52.299
It cannot be less than anything. So, for example, if you assume tool… Oh, okay, okay, okay. So, when you will compare it, it will not get a minus in the code.

00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:57.382
Okay. For example, if I move at 7? Yeah.

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:57.179
Okay. So, for example, if I compare 2 with 7… Yeah.

00:10:57.649 --> 00:10:59.649
And maximum, I'm assuming, is 2.

00:10:58.028 --> 00:11:00.028
And maximizing this tool.

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:01.733
So, is the maximum less than?

00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:02.097
So is the maximum less than?

00:11:02.737 --> 00:11:08.737
this number? Uh… No. If, for example, let's say, right now it's less, it should not be less.

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:10.184
No. If, for example, let's say, right now it's less, it should not be less, but it says…

00:11:09.609 --> 00:11:11.609
Rich says, if it's less, then what should I do?

00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:12.162
If it's less, then what should I do?

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:17.671
If it says it's voice. Yeah, if it's less, then what should I do? Because if it's true, I just move on.

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:17.911
If it says it's false. Yeah, if it says, then what should I do? Because if it's true, I don't know what…

00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:21.134
I will just keep moving on, right? Until the… Until you find it.

00:11:18.584 --> 00:11:21.584
I would just keep moving on, right? Until you find it.

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.334
Okay. Until the list finished, let's say, right?

00:11:21.562 --> 00:11:23.562
Okay. I think I'm gonna finish me today.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:26.755
So I keep moving on, but… but what if…

00:11:24.212 --> 00:11:27.212
Like, keep moving on. But what if…

00:11:27.818 --> 00:11:35.818
The maximum work number is less than the upcoming item, so… The maximum number is? Variable. Let's say you have a variable called max underscore none.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
The maximum work number is less than the upcoming item.

00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:36.032
So… The maximum number is less?

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:40.805
Yeah. But max number… this variable is less than the upcoming item in the list, so…

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.010
Yeah. But max number, this variable is less than the upcoming item in the list, so…

00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:43.013
What should you do with this variable?

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:43.969
What should… what should you do with this variable?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Excellent. Return faults.

00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:47.239
The 10 folks? Um, forces…

00:11:46.326 --> 00:11:52.326
Uh, false is… like, if it's false, then what do you do? It will complete, it will, it will, like, it will go also.

00:11:47.672 --> 00:11:52.672
Like, if I just lost them, what will you do? It will complete, it will, it will, like, it will go also.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:58.529
Yeah, actually, loop is fine. See, so you are scanning one by one numbers, right? Yeah.

00:11:53.812 --> 00:11:58.812
Like, he loop, you mean, mister? Maybe I didn't get you. Yeah.

00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:03.363
Can you tell me, like, how do… how will you compare, and what will you do? Just logical.

00:11:59.743 --> 00:12:03.743
Independent, how will you compare it, what will you do, just logically.

00:12:04.297 --> 00:12:07.297
So, what is your comparison logic, actually?

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.739
So, what is your comparison initiative?

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.470
Substruction.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:15.788
If it's less… if this one is less than this, so this one is bigger. So, for example, 2 minus 7?

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.140
If it's less, if this one is less than this, so this one is bigger.

00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:18.378
Ugh, it's minus 5.

00:12:17.055 --> 00:12:22.055
Ugh, it's minus 5. Or let's say minus 5 or 5, right? 5 or 5. Then 5 would…

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:22.333
Ministry of Hybrid. Five, okay.

00:12:22.427 --> 00:12:24.427
5 is the maximum?

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.411
No, they're not, uh…

00:12:24.804 --> 00:12:26.804
No, they're not, uh…

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:29.575
This one would be. If there is no minus, you mean?

00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:30.102
this one would be… if there is no minus, you mean?

00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:35.111
You got me? Okay, for example, yeah.

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:35.541
You go to me? Ms. For example, yeah.

00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:39.225
Let's say if there's minus, right? So, meaning… meaning the assumption was wrong.

00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:39.404
let's say if there's minus, right? So, meaning… meaning the assumption was wrong.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.400
Okay. But if we don't have minors, then it's maximum, something like that, right?

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:44.094
2 is not maximum, right? Okay. But if we don't have minus, then it's maximum, something like that, right?

00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:53.295
Again, say it again. Like, for example, what you're saying is, for example, if I get a negative integer, it means that, uh, it's… So it's less than that.

00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:50.909
Like, for example, what you're saying is, for example, if I get a negative… Yeah.

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:53.962
things that, uh… This one is less than that.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.080
Okay. Which is the same thing, kind of, as true or false, right? Same thing.

00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:58.371
Which is the same thing, kind of folks might see. Yeah.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.650
Oh, yes, then what you do? What do you do?

00:12:58.887 --> 00:13:00.887
Yes, then what do you do? What do you do?

00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:08.162
Let's say you find… you find this is less than 7, and this is correct, right? So, this is how you can find… that's fine, right?

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:06.922
let's say you find… you find this is less than 7, and this is correct, right? So this is how you can find it.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:11.067
After you find the inward, just move on, or, like…

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:11.312
After you find the number, just move one order, right?

00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:14.594
Or stop and do something first, and then move on.

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:14.767
to stop and do something first, and then move on.

00:13:15.374 --> 00:13:22.374
Okay, let's try it. Let's say, let's say… We have to compare the comparisons, maybe? Okay, let's say you find out 7S,

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:20.756
Okay, let's try it. Let's say, let's say… We have to compare the comparisons, maybe?

00:13:20.764 --> 00:13:22.764
Okay, let's say you find out Candace.

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:27.099
the maximum. The maximum, right? So, now 7 becomes the maximum. Now what?

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:27.604
the maximum. The maximum, great. So, now 7 becomes the maximum. Now what?

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:32.633
But 7 is not the maximum. It's not… It's not the maximum. Okay. 10 is the maximum.

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:32.775
But 7 is not the maximum. It's not… it's not the max? Okay.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.940
No, we have to let it complete. Yes, right? Yeah.

00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:35.241
No, we have to let it complete.

00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:37.918
So, um…

00:13:35.952 --> 00:13:37.952
Yeah. So, um…

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:42.817
loop, really? Of course, loop. We are just iterating on…

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:43.137
loop, right? Of course, loop, we are able to loop. Yeah, so immediately it will…

00:13:43.862 --> 00:13:46.862
I don't know if we can do this, like, if…

00:13:44.714 --> 00:13:48.714
With our own… I don't know if we can do this, like, if we can compare all.

00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:50.282
And compare all the subtraction between them.

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:50.675
the subtraction between them.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
Simplexity.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:55.373
Okay, for example, let's say, uh, you subtract this, right? Yeah.

00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:55.826
you subtract this rate. Yeah.

00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:57.541
Uh, you've changed, uh…

00:13:56.304 --> 00:13:58.304
You've changed, uh…

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.504
Let's see, um…

00:13:59.369 --> 00:14:05.369
let's say you… or, for example, let's say, just imagine this is 12. Just imagine, right? Okay.

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:02.601
That's a bullshit.

00:14:02.763 --> 00:14:05.763
just imagine there's 12… just imagine, right? Okay.

00:14:05.718 --> 00:14:08.718
This is the maximum, right? You compare…

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.762
This is the maximum, right?

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:10.479
you compare, you get, uh…

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:13.731
You get, uh, plus positive, let's say, right? Yeah. Something. So…

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:13.199
Plus, positive flip side, right? Yeah. Something?

00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:17.771
Then, you say, okay, 12 is the maximum. Then you go forward,

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.830
So, then you say, okay, 12 is the maximum.

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:20.501
Then you go forward, and then you compare what Plex 7 with 10.

00:14:18.088 --> 00:14:20.088
And then you compare, what, like, 7 with 10?

00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:28.991
like, for example, first you did these two, right? Then you do these two, then of course, you get minus, so… And also here I'll get plus 5.

00:14:22.231 --> 00:14:26.231
like, for example, first you did restore, right? Then you would do these two, then of course, you get

00:14:26.454 --> 00:14:31.454
minus, so… Also, here I'll get plus 5, and here 12 and 175.

00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:31.414
And here at 12… So you keep changing the maximum.

00:14:31.608 --> 00:14:40.608
Yeah, it's changing. You're not storing the maximum. You have to retain the maximum. We'll define this as either in A, B, anything.

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:34.198
Yeah, it's changing, I got it.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:40.999
You're not storing the mix. You have to retain the message. Oh, we'll define this as, I don't know, NAP did anything.

00:14:41.729 --> 00:14:43.729
The differentiation between them.

00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:44.111
the differentiation between them.

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:48.033
Yes, but this is… Yeah, but this is the logic, like, how?

00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:48.381
Yes, but this… Yeah, but this is the logic, like, how…

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.262
This was the question, actually.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.300
This is the question.

00:14:51.452 --> 00:14:54.452
Yes, you are right. See, the core logic that you're putting is right, but

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:54.916
Yes, you're right. Steve, the core logic that you're putting is right, but…

00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:57.905
Programmatically, how would you do it? Not in Python, but in any language.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.250
Programmatically, how would you do it? Not in Python, but in any language.

00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:04.182
Uh, I don't know if this is what you need to start, but, like, for example, that we can…

00:14:59.657 --> 00:15:03.657
Uh, I don't know if this is what you mean, Mr., but like, for example,

00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:06.142
that we can name this number.

00:15:04.555 --> 00:15:13.555
name this number. Like, for example, index 1 and index 2 minus that one. Let's say you have indexes, then what?

00:15:07.078 --> 00:15:13.078
Like, for example, index 1 and Index 2 minus that one.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.190
Yeah, then…

00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.151
Yeah, then, like, uh…

00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:17.178
like, uh…

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:19.374
Like, for example, N.

00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:19.701
Like, for example, N.

00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:24.484
Uh, and it's the number that we are… here, I mean, this, like, minus 5.

00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:24.838
Uh, and it's the number that we are… here, I mean, this, like, minus 5.

00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:26.693
This is what we are taking, and N is…

00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:29.901
this is what we are taking, and N is subtracting the indexes.

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:29.728
uh, subtracting the indexes.

00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:35.151
Make this tiny. Yep. I mean, I understand. Like, for example, if you…

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:35.596
Like this money. Yep. I mean, I understand. Like, for example, if you…

00:15:36.243 --> 00:15:43.243
Uh, you can definitely define the logic. I trust you, right? Yeah, I just… I just don't know what exactly to make, but I just… You have to store…

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:42.573
You can definitely define the logic. Yeah, I just, I just didn't know what exactly, right? But I just…

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.990
the street.

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:46.186
the state, because you're losing the state.

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:50.012
Because you're losing the state. Because as soon as you move forward, you lose…

00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:49.661
Because as soon as you move forward, you lose…

00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:53.524
What is the maximum? Because, see, think about it, 12… 7, 12 is the maximum.

00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:53.765
towards the next loop? Because, see, think about it. 12… 7, 12th is the maximum.

00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:55.792
When you move forward now, 7 and 10.

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.162
When you move forward now, 7 and 10.

00:15:56.124 --> 00:16:02.124
Automatically, what will happen, as soon as you see the minus, you will say, oh, I have the minus, which means 10 is the maximum.

00:15:56.682 --> 00:15:59.682
Automatically, what will happen as soon as you see the virus, you can say no.

00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:02.433
I have the master, which means 10 is the meeting.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.560
Although 12 was the maximum. Like, I assume, like, 12 will go for every one of them?

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:07.921
Although 24 is the maximum. So, like, I assume, like, 12 will go for every one of them?

00:16:08.729 --> 00:16:13.729
And I, um… Now, this is what you have to think, right? The statement is like this one moves with me.

00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:14.087
And I, um… This is what you have to think about. The statement is like this one moves with me.

00:16:13.943 --> 00:16:18.943
If anything more than… more than five, or more than…

00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:18.071
Minus 5. If anything more than… more than 5?

00:16:18.658 --> 00:16:20.658
more than 5?

00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:21.515
Hi, I got your point. So, for example,

00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:22.801
So…

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:24.631
So, do you store it somewhere? Like, what do you do?

00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:24.891
Do you steward something that would be doing?

00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:26.614
this result.

00:16:24.972 --> 00:16:26.972
this reserved.

00:16:27.594 --> 00:16:29.594
Like, minus 5 would you store it? Because… Yeah.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.930
Like, minus 5 produce 200, because… Yeah.

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:35.964
Because I want to differentiate between all of those. Okay, let's say X equal to minus 5, right? Okay.

00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:34.068
Because they want to differentiate it between all of those.

00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:36.429
Okay.

00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:39.206
So, for example, x equal to minus 5 now. Oh, okay, good, okay.

00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:39.547
Oh, okay, okay, good.

00:16:39.409 --> 00:16:42.409
If… sorry, I'm sorry.

00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:44.396
if… sort of stuff. If, uh…

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:45.705
If, uh, 7 minus 10.

00:16:45.152 --> 00:16:47.152
7 minus 10 is, uh…

00:16:45.694 --> 00:16:47.694
is, uh…

00:16:47.646 --> 00:16:49.646
Less than X,

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:49.939
less than X?

00:16:51.297 --> 00:16:56.297
7 minus 10, huh? It's less than… Okay, okay. It's not… it's not the maximum. If it's, uh…

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:53.411
It's less than, uh…

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.834
It's not… it's not the maximum. If it's, uh…

00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:05.181
Now, good, very good, right? Yeah, so you are keeping this straight, right? But where's the number? In the end, once you are done, how would I know the number, the exact number? I would know the…

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.920
Yes, we are keeping the street.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:05.478
But where's the number? In the end, once you're done, how would I know the number, the exact number? I would know the…

00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:12.952
Oh, okay. Your mathematical calculation, but here is the number. So, can you use another variable, please, to just store the number also?

00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:09.766
Oh, okay.

00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:13.208
Yes.

00:17:13.853 --> 00:17:18.853
beef. Yeah, just use anything. It's fine. You can right-click, for example, let's say…

00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:16.572
be.

00:17:17.325 --> 00:17:20.325
lead, for example. For example, let's say B. Yeah.

00:17:19.196 --> 00:17:21.196
be. Yeah. So…

00:17:21.537 --> 00:17:24.537
So… It is the number that is more than X.

00:17:22.194 --> 00:17:24.194
This is the number that is more than X.

00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:28.123
I think this one, yes, this one.

00:17:25.453 --> 00:17:28.453
I mean, isn't that? Yeah.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:37.965
Okay, that's fine. But this, I think, will work. Uh, although what I had in mind is, let's say you assume 2 is the maximum assume, right? And just simply compare.

00:17:29.853 --> 00:17:31.853
But this…

00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:36.791
Uh, although what I had in mind is, let's say you assume 2 is the maximum, assume, right?

00:17:36.803 --> 00:17:38.803
And just simply compute.

00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:43.189
2… if 2 is less than 7.

00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:43.581
2… F2 is less than 7.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400
If whatever this, uh, let's say, A is…

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:47.926
If whatever this, uh, let's say, A is…

00:17:48.098 --> 00:17:54.098
Who is it? FA, A should never be less than N1, right? Okay. But if it's less, update A.

00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:51.278
If A should never be less than anyone, right?

00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:53.859
Okay. But if it's less, update A.

00:17:55.225 --> 00:18:00.225
Okay. For example, see, if A is less than 7, then A becomes 7. That's simple, yeah, so…

00:17:55.487 --> 00:18:00.487
Okay. So, if A is less than 7, then A becomes 7. Oh, that's simple, yes.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.288
then we keep moving forward, right? Now, if A is less than 10,

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:03.704
And we keep moving forward, right? Now, if pay is less than 10,

00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:08.623
A becomes 10. If A is less than 5, then it becomes 5, but it's not less.

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:09.216
it becomes 10. If A is less than 5, then it becomes 5, or it's not less.

00:18:09.248 --> 00:18:13.248
No. Sorry. Then it will… 10 is not less than A, 10 is less than…

00:18:09.282 --> 00:18:13.282
Then it will… see, then it's not less than A, 10 is less than…

00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:15.772
Yeah, I agree with you, I agree with you.

00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:15.821
And then… I got your ideas working.

00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:22.718
Which is kind of the same thing with… No, but yours is, like, much simpler, because… No, no, yeah, but actually you got the logic, which is, like,

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:22.834
It's, like, similar, but yours is, like, much simpler, because maybe…

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:25.335
But it took some time, so…

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:30.741
Okay, let's move. Things stick things. Yeah, yeah. No, this is good, really.

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:30.776
Good things stick things. Yeah.

00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:36.395
Okay, now I will give you… let's talk about something. For example,

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:36.735
Okay, now I will give you, you know, a lecture of something. For example,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.860
Uh, you are building an application.

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:40.055
Uh, you're building an application. Okay. Right?

00:18:39.587 --> 00:18:47.587
A Python application, very simple. Okay. Nothing complex, right? Uh, you are actually… So you record the details in which to remind you?

00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:47.965
a Python application, very simple. Okay. Uh, you would actually… You said you record it? Do you want me to remind you?

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:51.336
you know, yes, it's… it's already recording. Oh. Everything.

00:18:48.924 --> 00:18:51.924
Oh, okay.

00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:56.209
So, let's say you are building an application for a client,

00:18:52.905 --> 00:18:56.905
So, let's say you are building an application for a client,

00:18:56.729 --> 00:18:58.729
And the client…

00:18:57.367 --> 00:18:59.367
And the glide…

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.670
needs something very simple calculator.

00:19:00.102 --> 00:19:02.102
needs something very simple calculator.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.808
Very simple, doesn't believe, right?

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:07.033
So, your application has functions like SUM,

00:19:04.487 --> 00:19:07.487
So, your application has functions like SUM,

00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:09.195
differentiate or add, subtract.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.814
differentiate or add separate, what do you plan to pay.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.520
Multiply and divide. But the client also

00:19:12.221 --> 00:19:15.221
But the client also needs to stew all of the history.

00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:14.934
store all of the history.

00:19:15.145 --> 00:19:17.145
the calculations, right?

00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:17.422
Okay.

00:19:18.385 --> 00:19:21.385
Now, if you want to… and he also wants to know the time.

00:19:18.543 --> 00:19:21.543
Now, if you want to… and he also wants to know the time.

00:19:22.154 --> 00:19:24.154
Where he performed the calculation, right? Okay.

00:19:22.434 --> 00:19:24.434
will perform the conversion trip. Okay.

00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:26.655
I have the choices.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.800
Now, you have two choices. Either you can use a dictionary to store,

00:19:27.123 --> 00:19:29.123
Either you can use a dictionary to restore,

00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:33.414
Or you can use a list to store the history. Which one would you use?

00:19:34.624 --> 00:19:36.624
And bye.

00:19:35.138 --> 00:19:37.138
And why? Dictionary.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.410
Dictionary, okay. And what's the reason behind dictionary?

00:19:37.804 --> 00:19:40.804
dictionary over there. And what is the reason behind the dictionary?

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:44.119
Because when we literary, it's like…

00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:44.452
Because when we do a dictionary, it's like…

00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:47.222
You evaluate, like, descriptor?

00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:48.708
much… I don't know what the word…

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.700
descriptive? Verbos?

00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:50.946
I'm understanding the Arabic, huh?

00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:56.312
Yeah, like, what neat, like, it's… all of them are their list, it's, uh…

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.750
Yeah, like, not neat, like, it's… it's… all of them are there. List, it's, uh…

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.040
It does not mean if you have missed, it will be, like, more accurate, or you can…

00:19:57.239 --> 00:20:01.239
It does not mean if you have lists, it will be, like, more accurate, or you can…

00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:07.951
put a lot of things and everything. Okay, so, for example, but remember, see, because this is a calculator application,

00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:03.697
put a lot of things and everything.

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:08.766
So, for example, but remember, see, because this is a calculator application,

00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:12.495
And the person is performing, like, hundreds of calculations.

00:20:09.925 --> 00:20:12.925
And the person is performing, like, hundreds of calculation

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:14.719
per minute. And rates, right?

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:15.059
per minute. Okay. Andreas, right?

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.982
So…

00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:17.189
So…

00:20:17.642 --> 00:20:24.642
And you're storing hundreds of calculations, and imagine if there are many employees, so thousands of calculations,

00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:23.001
And you are storing hundreds of calculations, and imagine if there are many employees,

00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:28.173
So, thousands of calculations. Thousands of calculations per minute are happening.

00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:27.945
Thousands of calculations per minute are happening.

00:20:28.158 --> 00:20:30.158
Okay. Right? So…

00:20:28.492 --> 00:20:30.492
Okay. So…

00:20:30.205 --> 00:20:34.205
Do you still think storing it in a dictionary is a good idea?

00:20:31.587 --> 00:20:34.587
Are you still think the dictionary is a good idea?

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:38.202
Do you think, yeah, the share is better than the rest.

00:20:35.706 --> 00:20:39.706
You think yes, sharing is better than the list? Better, better, right. So…

00:20:38.151 --> 00:20:40.151
Thank you.

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:43.542
Okay, if I… let's say if I used a list.

00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:43.866
Okay, before I… let's say if I used understood.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.790
Do you think the list… storing in the list continuously

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.830
Do you think the list…

00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:47.948
So, the list continuously.

00:20:48.135 --> 00:20:50.135
is much faster than storing in the dictionary.

00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:50.551
It's much faster than the stone in the dictionary.

00:20:51.798 --> 00:20:53.798
Uh, just your thoughts, like, what do you think?

00:20:52.534 --> 00:20:54.534
It's doing commercial equipment.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
No? Nope. Same?

00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:56.509
Yep. See?

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.004
It's not the same.

00:20:56.842 --> 00:20:58.842
Yeah.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:04.266
Uh…

00:21:04.377 --> 00:21:06.377
If you want to…

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:10.119
If you want to access a calculation for a specific time.

00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:09.823
access a calculation for a specific time.

00:21:09.816 --> 00:21:11.816
Right? So…

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:17.478
So… the dictionary give you benefits. It won't take long.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.080
Would dictionary give you benefits, or would list… what would take long?

00:21:19.122 --> 00:21:25.122
let's say if you're using a list, or you… or on the same kind of application, you're using a dictionary.

00:21:20.367 --> 00:21:22.367
Let's say if this audio.

00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.803
Or, um, the same kind of application you're using at Dictionary.

00:21:26.331 --> 00:21:29.331
And you want to access the history, right?

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.619
And you want to access the history, right?

00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:32.745
You just see what I did yesterday at 9pm.

00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:32.788
Just to see what I did yesterday.

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:34.993
So, what would be frustration?

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.335
So, what would be faster?

00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:38.901
In terms of accessing. Yeah, dictionary your list.

00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:39.252
In terms of access. Searching, manually.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.430
Uh-huh.

00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:45.794
Oh.

00:21:47.649 --> 00:21:53.649
Which, sorry, is the same that we did, like, when it has the menu, right?

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:52.396
dictionary is the same that we did, like…

00:21:52.283 --> 00:21:54.283
when it has the menu, right?

00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:59.338
Okay. That one, I just want to make sure that the dictionary where I put, like, uh…

00:21:54.693 --> 00:21:56.693
That one? I just want to make sure that…

00:21:57.499 --> 00:21:59.499
The dictionary where… where we put, like, the…

00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:02.989
the menu of what we do, and then exit that one, or you…

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:03.305
the menu of what we do, and then exit that one?

00:22:03.377 --> 00:22:09.377
Uh, but what is a dictionary? Tell me, what is a Python dictionary? Like, how does it look like?

00:22:03.829 --> 00:22:08.829
Now, important? Same as that one.

00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:13.948
Or you can just, if you don't want to explain, you can write, like, how does it look like?

00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:14.116
You can just… I'm explaining it right, like, I was…

00:22:14.218 --> 00:22:17.218
to that, like, conceptually, how does it look like? Dictionary?

00:22:14.742 --> 00:22:16.742
material, like, conceptually, how does it look?

00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:24.758
Just, uh, think about it, just take a minute.

00:22:25.758 --> 00:22:27.758
Salamu alayhum.

00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:28.164
So…

00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:33.155
We have our interviews are related to that.

00:23:00.357 --> 00:23:02.357
Yeah, sweetheart.

00:23:03.332 --> 00:23:07.332
List, you know, right? There's a list. So how does a dictionary look like, right?

00:23:03.614 --> 00:23:07.614
Yes, Mr.

00:23:10.272 --> 00:23:12.272
Okay, how does a tuple look?

00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:12.623
Okay, how does a tuple look like?

00:23:13.146 --> 00:23:15.146
Couple.

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:16.759
Do you remember tuckles? Yeah.

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:17.259
Yeah.

00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:24.871
Uh, it actually is like this. The only difference is, like, it has round brackets, right? For each one. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

00:23:17.966 --> 00:23:21.966
It actually is like this. The only difference is, like, it has long brackets, right?

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:25.028
For each one. What is the difference between…

00:23:26.152 --> 00:23:29.152
One is for numbers and one is… can be both for…

00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:30.191
Conceptually. It can be both for, like, one isn't take…

00:23:29.972 --> 00:23:34.972
Like, when is it to… I… whatever constraint, you can install in the top of it.

00:23:30.913 --> 00:23:35.913
I began to struggle both, like, whatever you're gonna store in the list, you're gonna store in trouble. Now, what is the difference?

00:23:34.924 --> 00:23:36.924
Now, what is the differences?

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:41.019
You don't have to remember the specific terminology.

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:41.319
You don't have to remember the specific terminology.

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.919
conceptually, right? Just whatever you think.

00:23:42.095 --> 00:23:44.095
One such achievement. Everything.

00:23:44.453 --> 00:23:49.453
That's the difference. Yeah, I know, but I just don't say something wrong. Okay, uh, let's see…

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:48.289
Yeah, I know, but I just don't say something wrong.

00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:53.176
When I use the word constant, right? Like, constant.

00:23:51.398 --> 00:23:53.398
When I use the word constant, right? Like, constant.

00:23:53.694 --> 00:23:55.694
Versus variable.

00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:56.044
versus medical.

00:23:56.363 --> 00:23:59.363
So, if I use the word constant versus a variable,

00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:59.561
So, if I use the word constant versus a variable,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.690
So what is the difference between these two words?

00:24:00.018 --> 00:24:02.018
So what is the difference between these two purchases?

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:04.799
Conception. Constant?

00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:05.152
What section? Constant?

00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:06.889
end variable.

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:12.149
something that changed, and the other one is something that's always the same.

00:24:08.479 --> 00:24:12.479
something to change, and the other one is something that's always the same thing.

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:14.161
Yeah, so you know, right? Yeah.

00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:14.531
Yeah, so you know. Yeah.

00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:16.418
you know, but you are not able to explain.

00:24:14.742 --> 00:24:16.742
you do, but you're not able to explain.

00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:19.489
I just don't want to say something at all. No, no, you know.

00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:19.301
I just didn't say something.

00:24:20.082 --> 00:24:25.082
You know it. Tuples cannot change once they're defined, right? Lists can change.

00:24:20.365 --> 00:24:25.365
But truffles cannot change once they're defined, right? Lists can change.

00:24:25.144 --> 00:24:31.144
Yeah. So one is immutable, the other is mutable, right? Anyways, but I mean, I just need to…

00:24:25.932 --> 00:24:27.932
So, one is infiltrative, others…

00:24:29.404 --> 00:24:34.404
Anyways, but I need… I just need to make sure that you can understand, right, and you are capable.

00:24:31.334 --> 00:24:34.334
Make sure you can understand, right? And you are capable.

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:36.956
Search, okay, let's go.

00:24:37.564 --> 00:24:42.564
if someone is not capable, then there's a real concern, then they need special attention, right?

00:24:38.701 --> 00:24:42.701
if someone is not given, then there's a bit of something really special.

00:24:45.055 --> 00:24:47.055
Okay, so…

00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:47.526
Okay, so…

00:24:48.938 --> 00:24:52.938
We were talking about your calculator application, right? Yeah. So, you take it for me.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:58.170
we were talking about your calculator application, right? Yeah. So, you will take it further. Okay. Now, if I'm running your… if I'm the client, I'm using your calculator application,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:58.490
Okay. Now, if I bring you a couple… if I'm the client using your calculator application,

00:24:58.982 --> 00:25:03.982
I'm performing calculations, you are storing it in, let's say, a dictionary, right? Okay.

00:25:00.173 --> 00:25:04.173
Addiction, right? Okay.

00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:06.149
When I exit your application,

00:25:04.884 --> 00:25:06.884
When you exit your position.

00:25:07.785 --> 00:25:10.785
Do I lose all the data on the history? No, no, no, it doesn't.

00:25:08.045 --> 00:25:12.045
We use all the data on the history? No, no, no, I just… I do not use that.

00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:14.667
So, if I read on your application again, how would I know?

00:25:12.992 --> 00:25:14.992
But it will… it will not keep running.

00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:18.828
No, it will not keep running. Let's say I exit it, right? Yeah. It stops.

00:25:16.203 --> 00:25:18.203
Next slide. Yeah.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.390
It just stops. Yeah. Like, say,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:25.690
Yeah. Let's say I reboot the computer, right? And then run your application again. Can I still see, check my history?

00:25:22.004 --> 00:25:26.004
I mean, can I still see, check my history?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.380
old calculations that I did.

00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:34.595
If you… if you push it, Vanny in…

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.831
If you… if you push a scanning in…

00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:37.468
you will, you will get it there, yeah.

00:25:35.578 --> 00:25:37.578
you will… you will get it there.

00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:47.785
If I push it too? Yeah, like, to get, for example, hello. Okay, okay, so… Yes, okay, no, no, like, I… I want to make sure that everything…

00:25:39.364 --> 00:25:44.364
Yeah, like, to GitHub, for example. Okay, okay, so… This is what you mean.

00:25:45.303 --> 00:25:48.303
Yes, okay, no, no. But you have to make sure that everything…

00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:53.579
Can you make a comment for it in this meeting or something else? No, no, something else. So, for example,

00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:52.469
And you add a comment for it like this, you mean, or something else?

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:54.446
For example…

00:25:54.044 --> 00:25:58.044
even if you put it… push it to GitHub, so that's your code, right?

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.350
Even if you book it approved within the week, so that's your program.

00:25:58.185 --> 00:26:02.185
It's not the calculation data, right? So, for example, I'm…

00:25:58.482 --> 00:26:00.482
And the code, yeah.

00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:07.419
I have… I have performed many calculations. You are storing it in a dictionary, right? Yeah.

00:26:02.804 --> 00:26:07.804
I have… I have performed many calculations. You're storing it in a dictionary, right? Yeah.

00:26:07.954 --> 00:26:11.954
So, of course, when you stop your program, stop the application, exit it,

00:26:08.244 --> 00:26:12.244
So, of course, when you stop your program, stop duplication. Exit it.

00:26:12.063 --> 00:26:14.063
and run it again fresh.

00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:14.341
and run it again freshly.

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:19.659
So, do you lose the data, or do you still have the calculation data? The one for contacts.

00:26:15.018 --> 00:26:20.018
So, do you lose the data, or do you still have… Well, it's like that, uh, the one for contacts.

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:26.746
The one for? When we do the contacts number and the… Yeah, that's it, yeah. You can think about it like this, yeah.

00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:26.231
What's up? When we did the contacts number and the… Like that one?

00:26:27.257 --> 00:26:32.257
So, do I lose the data, or do I still have the data? Can I access the old data? You can access it.

00:26:27.657 --> 00:26:32.657
So, what's the data, or do I still have the data? Can I access the code? You can access it.

00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:34.414
Uh, from the dictionary?

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:34.792
Uh, from the dictionary?

00:26:34.904 --> 00:26:38.904
Yeah. But when you run the application, dictionary is initialized again, like, it's empty.

00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:39.028
Yeah.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:49.160
Because you define, then you store it, then the person stores. As the… from the website, or as the window? Website, or from the… Or when you run it. From console CLI.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:49.400
As you define, then you store it, then the person stops. From the website, or as when… Website? Or when you run it?

00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:51.042
Both with whatever.

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:51.289
both ways, whatever.

00:26:52.347 --> 00:26:55.347
You can actually… because think about it, you're in the…

00:26:52.594 --> 00:26:55.594
You can actually… because think already, when you run the application again,

00:26:55.703 --> 00:26:57.703
New York.

00:26:55.826 --> 00:26:58.826
Import… import time.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.810
Import time.

00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:01.254
initialized dictionary equal to empty.

00:27:01.763 --> 00:27:03.763
And then show the menu, for example.

00:27:02.244 --> 00:27:04.244
And then show the menu, for example.

00:27:03.886 --> 00:27:05.886
And then now, insert…

00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:06.219
And then now, insert.

00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:10.726
perform my calculation, press enter, then it stores to the dictionary. So the dictionary has nothing.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.440
You press enter, then it stores to the chains. So the picture has nothing.

00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:13.965
What about the old records?

00:27:12.615 --> 00:27:14.615
What about food reports?

00:27:14.768 --> 00:27:17.768
That we had. They are gone, right? I just want to say… ask you, like,

00:27:15.325 --> 00:27:19.325
I just wanted to ask you, like, are they going…

00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:19.751
Are they gone or not?

00:27:22.251 --> 00:27:32.251
You can say they're not gone, or you can say, yes, they can be done. I just feel that they are not going, but I don't, like, I don't know where exactly where I'll find it. Okay, no, sure.

00:27:23.343 --> 00:27:29.343
You can see they're normal. What you can say is… I just, I just feel that they are not going, but I don't, like…

00:27:30.058 --> 00:27:32.058
I don't know where exactly to… where I'll find it.

00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:36.826
Or if there is something that I should write it before, that… so I cannot lose…

00:27:33.323 --> 00:27:37.323
Or if there's something that I should write it before, that… so I cannot lose them?

00:27:37.026 --> 00:27:43.026
No, sure, I'm just writing these things so we can have a revision later. Anyways… Well, that means move forward.

00:27:38.121 --> 00:27:41.121
No, I'm just trying to explain so we can have a division that continues.

00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:43.461
So that means it's… it's wrong.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:50.579
No, no, if I write something, it doesn't always mean it's wrong. Oh, right. It can be partially correct also. So what I'm writing doesn't mean always is wrong.

00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:48.706
No, no, I like something that doesn't always mean it's wrong. Oh, right. It can be partially correct.

00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:52.941
Okay, so let's move forward.

00:27:51.873 --> 00:27:53.873
So, collection…

00:27:54.184 --> 00:27:56.184
Okay, so…

00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:56.636
Okay, so…

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.390
your application, calculate your application, right?

00:27:56.751 --> 00:28:01.751
Uh, you have application, you have to submit your application, right?

00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:06.566
Can I not store, uh… can I store your dictionary to a file?

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.030
Can I not store, uh… can I store your dictionary to a file?

00:28:08.663 --> 00:28:10.663
to a file using Python.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.240
looks like. Use it back then.

00:28:11.084 --> 00:28:17.084
Yeah. Uh, you can… I can… I think everything is possible.

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:16.918
Yeah. I think everything is possible with you.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.930
Okay, how would you store your dictionary into a file in Python?

00:28:19.294 --> 00:28:22.294
Okay, how would you store your dictionary into a pipe?

00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:24.291
Conceptually speaking.

00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:24.666
Conceptually speak.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.730
by PDFI file.

00:28:26.094 --> 00:28:28.094
PDFI.

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:32.939
file, let's say, TXT file, like, how… how do you keep the dictionary in the file?

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.180
Like, how… how do you keep the picture in the file?

00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:38.334
What can you do in Python? No need to remember the specific syntax, but

00:28:34.438 --> 00:28:38.438
What can you do in Python? No need to remember the specific syntax, but…

00:28:38.421 --> 00:28:40.421
some things should come in place.

00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:40.732
some… some interesting advice.

00:28:42.282 --> 00:28:45.282
Remember filing, Sweden? Filing, we did filing.

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:45.595
Filing? We did file it.

00:28:45.274 --> 00:28:47.274
A long time ago.

00:28:48.184 --> 00:28:55.184
Yeah, but I don't know what exactly we did. Okay, let's say you have a dictionary, right? With all of the calculations. Can you store it in a database?

00:28:48.408 --> 00:28:53.408
Yeah, but I don't know what exactly we did.

00:28:53.717 --> 00:28:55.717
Any student in the database?

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.140
Yes. Yes?

00:28:57.421 --> 00:29:02.421
Yes. Yes, so… but you cannot store to a file. You can store, of course, right? But how?

00:29:00.223 --> 00:29:09.223
But you can understand profile, you can store your profile, right? Okay, this is what I mean, I know that it's possible, but I didn't know how exactly. This is what I meant. So, now…

00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:08.618
Okay, how… I mean, I know that it's forcible, but I didn't know how exactly. Okay, okay. This is what I meant. So, now…

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.600
How would you store it in a database?

00:29:09.102 --> 00:29:11.102
How would you store it in a database?

00:29:11.563 --> 00:29:13.563
Forget about filing.

00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:20.041
what are the things that you want before you start a store into a database?

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.220
What are the things that you want before you start a store into a database?

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.220
I should save it.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.670
So I think Gityani? I should save it.

00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:36.088
Uh, say, for example, because then when you… yeah. You mean when, like, for one example… for example, when I push… For backup, let's say, as backup, yarnik? Data backup.

00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:29.605
see if, for example, because then when you…

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:34.690
Oh, you mean when, when, like, for one example… for example, when I push for…

00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:37.895
as both Briani?

00:29:37.022 --> 00:29:44.022
Only the calculations backup itself. Ah, the calculation of the holding. Code is GitHub, right? Let's say, right? But actually, the data that is produced

00:29:38.115 --> 00:29:44.115
on the cancellation, not the coding. Yeah. Actually, the data that is produced.

00:29:44.794 --> 00:29:48.794
client's data. The client will use your application, so it produces logs,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.800
client status. The client will use your application, so it produces logs.

00:29:48.863 --> 00:29:51.863
he has some data, history, so…

00:29:49.093 --> 00:29:52.093
he has some data, history, so…

00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:56.366
It's stored in a database. If you want to store it in a database, how would you do it?

00:29:52.505 --> 00:29:54.505
It's a student database.

00:29:54.722 --> 00:29:56.722
If you want to store it in a database, how would you do it?

00:29:57.372 --> 00:30:00.372
Conceptually, like, what components do you need in order for this to work?

00:29:57.664 --> 00:30:00.664
What's it? Like, what confidence do you need in order for this to work?

00:30:05.819 --> 00:30:10.819
Okay, let's say I wouldn't define a database. Like, what do you think when I say database?

00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:11.101
Okay, let's accountabilities. Like, what do you think when you say database?

00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:13.333
What is a database, actually?

00:30:13.466 --> 00:30:15.466
information that I have breakthrough.

00:30:13.847 --> 00:30:15.847
information that I have, like…

00:30:15.983 --> 00:30:19.983
like, for example, for the calculated, you're gonna set your… you have the…

00:30:17.288 --> 00:30:20.288
like, for example, for the calculator, the numbers that you have done in general.

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:23.685
calculations that they have done. Okay, like, uh…

00:30:21.128 --> 00:30:23.128
calculations that you have done.

00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:28.375
Like, uh… I am not asking for a specific definition, but what comes in your mind when people say,

00:30:24.236 --> 00:30:28.236
I am not asking for a specific definition, but what comes in your mind when people say,

00:30:29.393 --> 00:30:36.393
uh… how can you store the dictionary in the database, or how can you store data in the database? So, what comes in your mind? What is a database, then?

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.720
How can you store the dictionary in the database, or how can you store data in the database?

00:30:34.824 --> 00:30:36.824
What comes in your mind? What is a database like?

00:30:37.984 --> 00:30:44.984
Information. Information… store information retrieval, like, what is… Store. Store, right? So, storage area, storage place.

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:42.619
information. Information, smooth information to cable network. Store.

00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:45.461
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:46.281 --> 00:30:48.281
So, is your database…

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.644
So, is your database…

00:30:49.315 --> 00:30:53.315
Uh, when you store it in a database, are you storing in your hardware store, or SSD?

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:53.646
Uh, when you store it in a database, are you storing in your hardware store, SSD?

00:30:54.733 --> 00:31:00.733
No, no. It's not almost there, and I can if I want, but, like, here, it can be, like…

00:30:54.801 --> 00:31:00.801
It's not almost there, and I can if I want, but, like, here, it can be, like,

00:31:01.956 --> 00:31:06.956
in the laptop itself, like, in the cloud, or in the… Where is everything stored?

00:31:02.268 --> 00:31:04.268
Uh, in the… in the laptop itself, like…

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:07.109
in the cloud or in the… Where is everything?

00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:09.933
We are not talking about the cloud, your computer, right?

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.210
We're not talking about the cloud.

00:31:10.062 --> 00:31:12.062
So, let's say database is here.

00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:13.004
So let's say that this is you. Yeah.

00:31:12.408 --> 00:31:14.408
Yeah. So, where is databases stored?

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.999
So this…

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.820
is it stored in hard destroy for SSD, or not?

00:31:19.003 --> 00:31:23.003
Is it stored in our destroyed by SSD or not?

00:31:22.925 --> 00:31:38.925
Yeah. It's not everything stored in the SSD? But I mean, like, anything you have, you can store it in anywhere, you can… I mean, as long as you can transfer it to someplace to place. Okay, okay. Like, you're saying, like, in a hardcore USB owner and CPU, you can… you can transfer?

00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.951
Yeah. It's not everything's stupid.

00:31:26.312 --> 00:31:34.312
What I mean, like, anything you have, you can store it in anywhere, you can, Yanni, as long as you can transfer it to some place to place.

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:39.527
Like, you're saying, like, in the hardest core USB owner and CD, you can… you can transfer.

00:31:42.048 --> 00:31:48.048
Let's forget that, because we are going way too deep, right?

00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:47.857
Yeah. No, let's forget about the hardware, right? Let's forget that, because we are going way too deep, right?

00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:50.325
Uh, let's say you have to store in the database, right?

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:50.659
Uh, actually, you have to store in the database, right?

00:31:51.325 --> 00:31:55.325
So, what do you need to store in the database? What are the components? How would you just store

00:31:51.754 --> 00:31:55.754
So what do you need to be restoring the database? What are the components… how could you just destroy it?

00:31:55.383 --> 00:31:58.383
A dictionary into a database?

00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:58.829
a dictionary? Mm-hmm. Into a database?

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.350
Let's say it's MySQL database, right?

00:31:59.527 --> 00:32:01.527
Let's say it's MySQL database.

00:32:01.742 --> 00:32:04.742
So how would you store it in the MySQL database server?

00:32:02.363 --> 00:32:05.363
So how would you store it in the MySQL database server?

00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:11.035
No, no, conceptual, conceptual.

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:11.405
No, one sexual, conceptual.

00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:16.339
Not asking about the same protocol, okay, I will add this library, I will do that, right? Yeah, uh-huh.

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:16.763
I'm asking about the same focus. No, I did, uh-huh.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.810
Because if you tell it conceptually, it's okay.

00:32:21.014 --> 00:32:23.014
But if it's a load, then…

00:32:21.266 --> 00:32:24.266
But if you say no, then… then there's a problem, so…

00:32:23.205 --> 00:32:25.205
I think there's a post-op City.

00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:27.762
That's why I want to give you a chance, right, to just share your thoughts.

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:28.119
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:29.194 --> 00:32:31.194
Don't worry about it, like, be relaxed.

00:32:29.417 --> 00:32:31.417
Don't worry about, like, be relaxed.

00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:35.465
Remember, filing?

00:32:33.712 --> 00:32:35.712
Remember, Fireland?

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:43.021
But I don't know what exactly, like, what is it exactly that we have done. Okay, maybe I… I know that we can't… we can't change, we can't transfer, we can…

00:32:36.463 --> 00:32:43.463
But I didn't know what exactly, like, what is it exactly that we have done. But I know that we can, we can say that we can transfer, but we can.

00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:48.775
Thanks for it. I know that we can… Let's say this is a string, right? Hello world.

00:32:43.842 --> 00:32:48.842
for it. I know that we can do this. Let's say this is stupid.

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.367
Let's forget about Git also, GitHub also.

00:32:49.483 --> 00:32:51.483
Let's talk about great tools and data comes through.

00:32:52.186 --> 00:32:54.186
Just, hello world, this is a string, right? Spring.

00:32:52.615 --> 00:32:54.615
Just teleport?

00:32:55.709 --> 00:32:57.709
So I want to store this string in a database.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.980
So I want to store the string in a database.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.100
just simple text.

00:32:59.403 --> 00:33:01.403
Just simple text.

00:33:01.484 --> 00:33:03.484
So, what…

00:33:01.841 --> 00:33:08.841
So, what… uh, what are you thinking, like, how can you do it? I'm not asking about, like, specific names of libraries or everything.

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:07.079
What are typical, and how can you do it? And what does the format?

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.320
specific teams of, like, the news, or…

00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:12.947
Like, uh, how would it go out? What should be there?

00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:13.113
We did.

00:33:12.994 --> 00:33:14.994
like, where's this store, like…

00:33:13.337 --> 00:33:15.337
like, where's this tool, like…

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:20.428
Like, just components that would allow you to store this word.

00:33:17.807 --> 00:33:20.807
practice components that would allow you to store this world.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.400
in the database.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.730
in the darkness.

00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:27.629
Okay, let's… I will help you operate. So, MySQL…

00:33:25.094 --> 00:33:28.094
Okay, that's… MySQL…

00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:30.017
server.

00:33:28.383 --> 00:33:30.383
So…

00:33:30.989 --> 00:33:32.989
This is a database server, right?

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:35.999
And this is your .py file, right?

00:33:34.494 --> 00:33:36.494
And this is your dot privilege.

00:33:37.093 --> 00:33:39.093
Now, what would you do

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.290
Now, what would you do?

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.880
to store this word into the MySQL server.

00:33:40.147 --> 00:33:42.147
A strongly plugged into the MySQL server.

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:44.056
through your Python script.

00:33:42.428 --> 00:33:44.428
to your Python script.

00:33:44.803 --> 00:33:49.803
through your Python script. It sounds like a change will be. Like, for example,

00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.861
through your Python structure. It's not like changing…

00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:53.739
Like, for example, when you change the folder from Python to, like, for example.

00:33:50.342 --> 00:33:53.342
When you change the folder into, like, for example.

00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.901
Okay. Jason Legacyiano, or something else?

00:33:53.934 --> 00:33:56.934
Jason, like, do you see any, or something else?

00:33:57.624 --> 00:34:07.624
Let's say, okay, if you want to talk about JSON, let's say there's a file data.json, right? Am I understanding the question right? Is this what you mean? Like…

00:33:57.849 --> 00:34:03.849
Let's say, if you want to talk about JSON, like, there's a file data? No, but…json.

00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:09.388
I'm gonna… am I understanding the question right? Is this what you mean? Like, changing it from

00:34:07.558 --> 00:34:10.558
changing it from a Python…

00:34:10.657 --> 00:34:13.657
a Python? No, um, not this applicant.

00:34:11.098 --> 00:34:13.098
No, no, no. Not this up.

00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:18.828
like, through your Python script, inside Python, what would you do inside Python?

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.200
like, Google Python script. Yeah. It's like Python…

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.579
Right? Like, what commands would you write?

00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:23.471
Like, what commands would you write?

00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:26.416
Uh, that will store this string to a database server.

00:34:24.177 --> 00:34:27.177
that can destroy the student to a database center.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:33.969
I'm not sure, Mr. Ray. No need to remember the commands specifically, but, like,

00:34:29.872 --> 00:34:34.872
I'm not sure if I just don't say… Sorry to remember the amounts specifically, but, like…

00:34:34.765 --> 00:34:37.765
Okay, uh, we will come back to it later. Alright.

00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:38.283
Okay, uh, we'll come back to it later. Alright.

00:34:39.252 --> 00:34:43.252
Uh, you know, an application can be a client application, can be a server application, right? Yeah.

00:34:39.853 --> 00:34:42.853
Uh, you know, this might be a client application can be a server application.

00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:48.551
So, what is the difference between a client application and a server application? Core difference?

00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:48.946
So, what is the difference between a client application and server application? Or difference?

00:34:49.647 --> 00:34:54.647
What makes client application a client application? What makes server application a server application?

00:34:49.947 --> 00:34:54.947
What makes client application a client application? What makes software application a server application?

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:57.259
They're the technical, uh, any…

00:34:55.872 --> 00:34:57.872
There are the technical can A&E.

00:34:57.641 --> 00:35:01.641
can definitely change, add things like this, but the custody, the…

00:34:58.006 --> 00:35:02.006
can technically change, add things like this, but the…

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:08.101
like, the way it shows to them, how can they use that website or that application, or whatever.

00:35:03.364 --> 00:35:08.364
like, the way it shows to them, how can they use that website or that application?

00:35:08.707 --> 00:35:14.707
But that one is, like, it's behind the scenes. Server. We do it, yeah, the server, so what… what it shows to them.

00:35:09.876 --> 00:35:13.876
But that one is, like, it's behind the scenes. What did we do? Yeah, the server, so what…

00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:15.861
what it shows to them.

00:35:16.957 --> 00:35:18.957
Okay, okay. Uh, so…

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.980
Uh, so… is it possible, for example,

00:35:19.299 --> 00:35:21.299
Is it possible, for example,

00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:23.906
For the server.

00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:24.456
For the server. Hmm.

00:35:24.295 --> 00:35:27.295
to initiate the communication with the client.

00:35:24.641 --> 00:35:27.641
initiate the communication with the client.

00:35:27.203 --> 00:35:29.203
Or…

00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:29.771
Or…

00:35:29.307 --> 00:35:31.307
So, there are two scenarios, right?

00:35:29.876 --> 00:35:31.876
So, there's no understanding, right?

00:35:32.879 --> 00:35:38.879
Can the server initiate? I'm talking about, like, initial communication, right? Can the server initiate the communication with the client?

00:35:33.552 --> 00:35:39.552
Can the server initiate? I'm talking about, like, initial communication, right? Can the server initiate the communication with the client?

00:35:39.883 --> 00:35:42.883
Or should the client initiate the communication with the server?

00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:43.441
Or should the client kind of initiate the communication with the server?

00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:46.554
Uh, which statement is correct?

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:47.099
Uh, which is still kind of correct.

00:35:46.788 --> 00:35:48.788
Server initiates the…

00:35:47.265 --> 00:35:49.265
Several initiatives start.

00:35:49.992 --> 00:35:53.992
Uh, communication, or clients initiates the communication.

00:35:51.101 --> 00:35:54.101
Uh, communication, or clients initiates the communication?

00:35:54.335 --> 00:35:56.335
From these two statements, what do you think is correct?

00:35:54.645 --> 00:35:56.645
From these two statements, we're not indescribed.

00:35:57.168 --> 00:35:59.168
Communication, you mean, like… Like, uh…

00:35:57.453 --> 00:35:59.453
Communication, you mean, like…

00:35:59.646 --> 00:36:01.646
initial communication, like, for example,

00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:01.926
initiate a communication bank, for example?

00:36:01.978 --> 00:36:03.978
sending something to someone.

00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:04.469
Sending something to someone.

00:36:04.506 --> 00:36:07.506
No, but… You're sending us…

00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:07.909
you know, because from…

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.270
So starting a request, actually, let's say, right? From the client's server-to-server to…

00:36:08.454 --> 00:36:11.454
So, we had the question of James, even? From the clients, the server, server…

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:15.045
to another… if it's to another, uh…

00:36:12.162 --> 00:36:16.162
If it's to another… Okay, so what you're saying is,

00:36:15.698 --> 00:36:22.698
So what you're seeing is, it'll always be client as we do to initiate the deployment with the server? Uh, because he ordered the thing.

00:36:16.223 --> 00:36:22.223
It will always be… client is going to initiate the communication with the server. Ah, because he ordered that thing.

00:36:22.798 --> 00:36:24.798
Oh, yeah.

00:36:22.835 --> 00:36:24.835
Okay, yeah, now we're going to trade.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.140
Think about, right? So, in this script,

00:36:25.756 --> 00:36:28.756
Think about it. So, in this instance…

00:36:29.419 --> 00:36:31.419
This PVY is a client.

00:36:29.947 --> 00:36:31.947
This pivot is a client.

00:36:32.204 --> 00:36:34.204
Right? Application.

00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:34.567
Application.

00:36:35.556 --> 00:36:38.556
And this is, of course, by the name it says, like, server addiction, right?

00:36:36.225 --> 00:36:38.225
And this is, of course, very interesting.

00:36:39.477 --> 00:36:41.477
So, can you order?

00:36:39.926 --> 00:36:41.926
So, can you order?

00:36:42.768 --> 00:36:44.768
Can you order MySQL Server to store?

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.570
Can you order my SQL Server to store?

00:36:46.563 --> 00:36:51.563
But I didn't know, like, how… Yeah, how is not important. Yeah, it is possible.

00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:52.208
Yeah, it's just supposed to be… but I don't know, like, how. Yeah, it is possible.

00:36:52.236 --> 00:36:58.236
Yeah, right, so, yeah, I understand? Yeah, this is what I was saying, that it's possible, but I didn't know how Yani.

00:36:53.243 --> 00:36:58.243
Yeah, this is what I was saying, that it's possible, but I didn't know how, Yanni.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.600
Okay. Uh, what is the difference between an API endpoint versus a server application?

00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:03.967
What is the difference between an API endpoint versus a setup endpoint?

00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:05.841
How they are related.

00:37:06.085 --> 00:37:10.085
Server application versus an API endpoint.

00:37:06.431 --> 00:37:09.431
server application versus an EPA.

00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:12.625
Right?

00:37:13.016 --> 00:37:16.016
think about your first DK application, then you can come up with an answer.

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:16.736
Think about your first year, you should then be comfortable.

00:37:17.244 --> 00:37:20.244
Server application, right?

00:37:18.732 --> 00:37:20.732
FBI end? Similar finish, right?

00:37:20.478 --> 00:37:22.478
Like, uh…

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:25.665
how they are related, or is it the same thing? Like, what is going on?

00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:26.025
Is it the same thing? Like, what is going on?

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.640
So, I'm not sure, but several locations, the one that you are working on it?

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:41.010
So, but I'm not sure, but several locations is the one that you are working on it?

00:37:41.212 --> 00:37:47.212
Directly, but the API is the access that we get to another one.

00:37:42.482 --> 00:37:47.482
directly, but the API is the access that you can get to another one.

00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:49.545
like, for website and other…

00:37:47.887 --> 00:37:49.887
like for website and other…

00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:54.208
So, for example, uh, when you were building the calculator application for a client,

00:37:50.527 --> 00:37:54.527
So, for example, when you were building the calculator transcription from the bank.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.900
So that… you can call that a server application?

00:37:54.964 --> 00:37:56.964
So that… you can call that a certain application.

00:37:57.487 --> 00:38:02.487
Yeah. And API can be, for example, somewhere else, where people can actually reach out to it, right? Yeah.

00:37:57.759 --> 00:38:02.759
Yeah. An API can be, for example, somewhere else where people can actually reach out to it, right? Yeah.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.360
So…

00:38:22.402 --> 00:38:26.402
Uh, since we are talking about clients or whatnot, what is an IP address?

00:38:22.435 --> 00:38:26.435
Uh, since we are talking about clients, remember, what is an IP address?

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:28.719
IP. IP address, yeah.

00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:29.101
Might be? Identus.

00:38:29.462 --> 00:38:31.462
a reasonable that has, uh, been…

00:38:29.655 --> 00:38:31.655
I've used in a book that has, uh, like,

00:38:32.214 --> 00:38:35.214
Is it the address of the client or the server?

00:38:32.266 --> 00:38:35.266
Isn't that interesting?

00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:42.251
Uh, okay, so does client applic… does the client and the server both have an IP address?

00:38:37.723 --> 00:38:39.723
Uh, okay, so it has climbed up, please?

00:38:40.032 --> 00:38:45.032
Does the client and server both have an IP address, or is it just the server that has an IP address?

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:44.816
Or is it just the server that has the IP address?

00:38:49.958 --> 00:38:56.958
Let's say there are two machines, right? One is your laptop? Yeah. One is Google.com, right?

00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:53.189
like, has the number. No, it's only the server has it.

00:38:53.293 --> 00:38:57.293
Let's say… Yeah.

00:38:57.317 --> 00:38:59.317
Do both have an IP address?

00:38:57.698 --> 00:38:59.698
Do both have an IP address?

00:38:59.709 --> 00:39:03.709
Or is it only the server that has the IP address? They have it.

00:38:59.978 --> 00:39:06.978
Or is it only the server that has the IT process? They have it, but I can, like, ask for it.

00:39:03.633 --> 00:39:06.633
But I can, like, ask for it.

00:39:07.227 --> 00:39:10.227
But it cannot be sha… it's not shareable.

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.712
But it cannot be… it's not shareable.

00:39:10.353 --> 00:39:13.353
IP address? Uh, let's see.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.600
I think… Oh, that's see.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:17.849
Adverse. No, only, sir.

00:39:14.169 --> 00:39:18.169
Okay, okay. No, only sir.

00:39:18.117 --> 00:39:20.117
Only server typewriter, right?

00:39:18.538 --> 00:39:20.538
How many servings?

00:39:24.132 --> 00:39:29.132
So when you… if you open your command prompt and write ipconfix, so you don't see any IP address, right?

00:39:24.537 --> 00:39:29.537
So then, if you open your command prompt and write IP template so you don't see any of it as well.

00:39:30.279 --> 00:39:32.279
Yeah. You don't see?

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.820
Yeah. Oops.

00:39:32.388 --> 00:39:34.388
Any IP address?

00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:35.741
Where?

00:39:34.848 --> 00:39:36.848
Like, for example,

00:39:36.824 --> 00:39:38.824
Google and your laptop, right?

00:39:38.204 --> 00:39:40.204
Who are your laptop, right? Yeah. So…

00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:43.786
So, when you… if you open command prompt in your laptop and write IP,

00:39:41.174 --> 00:39:44.174
If you open to one front in your laptop, Android IP,

00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:45.778
IP config, or…

00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:46.151
If you can click on…

00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:48.191
So you see an IP address, right?

00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:48.631
So you see an IP address, right?

00:39:49.943 --> 00:39:53.943
In the command? Yes, like, for example, does your machine has an IP address?

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.310
in the… in the command?

00:39:54.877 --> 00:39:59.877
Yeah. So, your machine is a client? No, you are smiling, Mr.

00:39:55.251 --> 00:40:00.251
Yeah. You are smiling instead.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:08.280
I'm just trying to figure out, uh, the projection, right? What's your reaction can change my answers then, so…

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:07.754
I'm just trying to figure out, uh, the knowledge you have, right? Soyla? What's your reaction can change my answers, that's…

00:40:08.888 --> 00:40:11.888
Yeah, that's right. Because if you get confused, it means your concepts are not clear.

00:40:09.339 --> 00:40:12.339
Yeah, that's right. If you got confused with me to your concepts are not clear.

00:40:12.062 --> 00:40:15.062
But if you're confident, then it means it's great. So…

00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:15.367
But if you're confident, then…

00:40:15.867 --> 00:40:17.867
it's always about, like, if I say something,

00:40:16.264 --> 00:40:18.264
It's Amazon, like, I say something?

00:40:17.877 --> 00:40:19.877
You can guess the answer, that should not happen.

00:40:18.272 --> 00:40:20.272
You could guess it's awesome, but…

00:40:19.858 --> 00:40:21.858
Okay.

00:40:20.233 --> 00:40:22.233
Okay.

00:40:22.773 --> 00:40:29.773
But I can change the answer out of your reaction. No, no, totally. When I say, are you sure? Don't change, right? Because you say, I'm sure.

00:40:22.967 --> 00:40:29.967
But I can change the autopilot reaction, even if I was confident. Because you know what? I see, I'm sure I don't.

00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:35.736
But think about it, right? The server has the IP address,

00:40:37.413 --> 00:40:42.413
And your laptop also has the iPad as well, but otherwise, how would you, like, communicate with Google if there's no internet?

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.960
And your laptop also has the iPad, but otherwise, how could you, like…

00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:42.845
What if there's no demand.

00:40:42.786 --> 00:40:44.786
If there's internet, you have the IP address, right?

00:40:43.022 --> 00:40:45.022
Is it tonight?

00:40:44.762 --> 00:40:46.762
Okay, so…

00:40:45.023 --> 00:40:47.023
Okay, so…

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:51.378
What is the difference between a public IP address and private IP address? Do you know anything about it?

00:40:47.491 --> 00:40:51.491
What is the difference between a public IP address and private IP address? Do you know anything about it?

00:40:51.577 --> 00:40:54.577
Maybe the public one, anyone can access to it.

00:40:52.034 --> 00:40:55.034
move the public one, anyone can access to it.

00:40:55.369 --> 00:41:05.369
100% correct. Yeah, and by the other one, it's gonna be any… you don't want anyone to access it. Like, it's something you did for… Yeah, no, no, no, you're 100% right, yeah.

00:40:56.257 --> 00:41:00.257
100% correct. Yeah, but the other one, it cannot take any…

00:41:00.155 --> 00:41:05.155
You don't want anyone to access to it. Like, it's something you did for…

00:41:06.262 --> 00:41:10.262
Is it a B? Is there a way that I can actually access a private IP address?

00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:10.791
Is it a week? Is there a way that I can actually access a private IP address?

00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:13.345
From our site, is there a way? Yes or no?

00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:14.041
Actually, is there a bit? Yes or no?

00:41:13.818 --> 00:41:15.818
you know, the environment, yeah.

00:41:14.385 --> 00:41:16.385
If you know the area, yeah, you can.

00:41:16.547 --> 00:41:21.547
Uh, if you don't… if you know what… I would be so worth it. Like, the numbers you mean, Annie.

00:41:17.402 --> 00:41:22.402
I just didn't know if you saw with, like, the numbers, you mean, Yanni.

00:41:23.248 --> 00:41:27.248
Because as DevOps, we must know these things, right? So, for example,

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:34.319
I can… from my node, I cannot reach out to you.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:33.810
Is there a way? Yes, let's say you have a private IP address, I can… from my home, I cannot reach out to you.

00:41:34.822 --> 00:41:36.822
Still, is there a way I can reach out? Yeah.

00:41:35.314 --> 00:41:38.314
Still, is there a way I can reach out? Yeah, you can reach out.

00:41:38.573 --> 00:41:41.573
Uh, is there something coming to mind? No, I was going.

00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:41.846
Is there some… Well, what's this going? I didn't know.

00:41:42.473 --> 00:41:45.473
So, you can reach out is correct, right? Yeah. But you don't know the way is…

00:41:43.108 --> 00:41:46.108
So you can do this correctly, right? Yeah. But you don't know the way it is.

00:41:45.525 --> 00:41:48.525
So I will consider partially correct.

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.807
You can reach out. The report forwarding, I think.

00:41:50.335 --> 00:41:56.335
port forwarding, if you have that, that's pretty true.

00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:55.781
You can do port forwarding. You're behind that, and you can actually reach out.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.330
Which begs the question, what is the difference between IP address and port?

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:01.910
Okay. What is the difference between packages and work?

00:42:05.463 --> 00:42:07.463
I think you said they're not addicted to watching.

00:42:05.687 --> 00:42:08.687
I could use today not to dig much. Sweet?

00:42:07.544 --> 00:42:09.544
Let's see.

00:42:09.478 --> 00:42:13.478
Again? These are basics.

00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:13.083
Again? This is basic. These are basics. Then I will go to advanced.

00:42:13.872 --> 00:42:19.872
For now, what I'm asking is basically. No, no. I'm asking some intermediate questions also.

00:42:14.584 --> 00:42:17.584
Okay. Yeah, good to know, good to know.

00:42:17.693 --> 00:42:21.693
I'm asking some intermediate. Okay. It's not just speaking.

00:42:20.677 --> 00:42:23.677
Okay. It's not just easy, intermediate also. Alright. So, um…

00:42:21.723 --> 00:42:23.723
Alright.

00:42:24.012 --> 00:42:28.012
You're not doing that bad. It's, uh… it's okay. I'm just, like…

00:42:24.403 --> 00:42:26.403
They're not being that bad, so…

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.520
It's okay. I'm just, like…

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:34.670
Alright, so for example, uh, IP address and ports, right? So…

00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:34.291
No issues. Okay, so for example, IP address and ports, right? So…

00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:38.281
The last question I asked you was about, uh…

00:42:36.609 --> 00:42:38.609
The last question I asked you was about, uh…

00:42:39.396 --> 00:42:41.396
Uh, port forwarding, right?

00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:41.793
Uh, portfolio, right?

00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:47.709
Ah, just writing straight, right? Okay, now, IP address and port.

00:42:44.233 --> 00:42:48.233
Okay, now, IP address and pool.

00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:53.006
Like, what is the benefit of having a port when you already have the address of the server?

00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:53.149
like, what is the benefit of having a port when you already have the address of the server?

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.080
Like, for example?

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.560
Take, for example…

00:42:55.064 --> 00:42:57.064
Sometimes you need a rick.

00:42:55.432 --> 00:42:57.432
Sometimes you need, uh, like,

00:42:58.181 --> 00:43:00.181
You want to access it, uh…

00:42:58.297 --> 00:43:02.297
You want to access it, uh, at that time, you don't have Blake, for example.

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.511
at that time, you didn't have, like, for example.

00:43:02.377 --> 00:43:07.377
your laptop. Okay, uh, sorry, yes. No, like, if you are a team also…

00:43:02.963 --> 00:43:04.963
your laptop.

00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.961
No, like, if you are a team also.

00:43:07.568 --> 00:43:10.568
Sometimes you need to access it, like, you need another way.

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:10.859
Sometimes you need to access it, like, you need another way.

00:43:10.748 --> 00:43:15.748
To access it, yeah. Okay, okay, I got it. No issues. Let's jump to…

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.650
to access it, yeah. Okay.

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:16.339
Now, let's jump to…

00:43:18.066 --> 00:43:23.066
get right, because we have covered get in the beginning a lot, right? So, let's talk about…

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.250
get trait, because we have covered Git in the beginning a lot, right?

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.598
So, let's talk about…

00:43:25.253 --> 00:43:30.253
Uh, so you know, if you know the branch, right? Main branch, you have been seeing main branch…

00:43:25.595 --> 00:43:30.595
Uh, so yeah, uh, you know about the branch, right? Main branch, you have been seeing main branch a lot, right?

00:43:30.577 --> 00:43:33.577
So, and you do know about the connector.

00:43:30.692 --> 00:43:32.692
So, and you know about the commit.

00:43:33.718 --> 00:43:35.718
Commentary. So, uh…

00:43:34.149 --> 00:43:36.149
Gotcha. So, uh…

00:43:37.103 --> 00:43:40.103
What is the, like, what is the relationship between

00:43:38.642 --> 00:43:40.642
What is, like, what is the relationship between…

00:43:41.442 --> 00:43:43.442
a branch under government. Is there any relationship? Like…

00:43:41.989 --> 00:43:43.989
a branch check. I mean, is there any relationship? Like…

00:43:43.745 --> 00:43:46.745
is… does commit has something to do with the brunch?

00:43:44.468 --> 00:43:47.468
is… does Connet has something to do with the branch?

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:54.020
Comment? Uh-huh. The comet… does Commit has something to do with the branch? Yes or no? Simple.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.350
Comet? Uh-huh.

00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:54.471
Excuse me.

00:43:55.102 --> 00:43:57.102
But do think about it, right?

00:43:57.874 --> 00:43:59.874
Yes, it has. Okay, nice.

00:43:59.047 --> 00:44:01.047
Yes, it has.

00:44:00.729 --> 00:44:10.729
Uh, so, you're right. So, what, like, what does it have to do? It's different when you want to get back to it of that step that you have changed, for example.

00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:05.681
Uh, so, you're right. So, like, what does it do?

00:44:06.273 --> 00:44:11.273
It's the point when you want to get back to it, of that step that you have changed, for example.

00:44:10.852 --> 00:44:14.852
So, our commits saved inside the branch, or they are…

00:44:11.527 --> 00:44:15.527
to our commits safe inside the punch, or they're…

00:44:14.848 --> 00:44:16.848
They are saved somewhere else.

00:44:15.643 --> 00:44:17.643
see if somebody else's…

00:44:18.548 --> 00:44:20.548
Like, what I'm trying to say?

00:44:19.178 --> 00:44:21.178
Because I couldn't frequency?

00:44:21.304 --> 00:44:25.304
Are commit saved somewhere else, or other part of the branch, uh, which one is true?

00:44:21.372 --> 00:44:24.372
I finally received somebody else, but our Department of Crunch.

00:44:24.739 --> 00:44:26.739
Which one's true.

00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:30.169
First, uh, it goes to, uh…

00:44:28.651 --> 00:44:30.651
First, uh, it goes to, uh…

00:44:31.042 --> 00:44:33.042
With the name exactly, it goes…

00:44:31.342 --> 00:44:33.342
I forgot the name exactly. It goes…

00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:37.069
Uh, staging area? Yes, staging area, and then it goes to the front.

00:44:33.473 --> 00:44:37.473
Yeah, staging area, and then it goes to that one.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.240
Uh, and then it goes to the branch, 100% correct. Good. Nice.

00:44:39.632 --> 00:44:41.632
Uh, and then it goes to the ground. Yes.

00:44:42.778 --> 00:44:44.778
Right, so…

00:44:52.242 --> 00:44:57.242
if we, let's say, get GitHub, right? For example, uh, what do we use GitHub for?

00:44:52.421 --> 00:44:57.421
if we, let's say, hit up, right? What do you use data for?

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.090
Generally speaking.

00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:59.533
Generally speaking.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:06.640
Uh, it's helping us not to lose them for the coding that we have done. Or, for example, if we are working on a team,

00:44:59.826 --> 00:45:03.826
Uh, it's helping us not to lose them for the good thing that we have done.

00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:06.432
Well, for example, if I'm working on engineering.

00:45:06.488 --> 00:45:12.488
Yeah, and both of us want to work, for example. We all need to access…

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:10.519
Like, yeah, and both of us want to work, for example.

00:45:10.602 --> 00:45:12.602
We all need to access.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.300
If you don't have… imagine a world where there's legal. Yeah.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.530
If we don't have… imagine a world where there's no GitHub.

00:45:16.116 --> 00:45:21.116
Can we still create Git repos? Can we still do all of the branches, commits, and everything?

00:45:16.406 --> 00:45:21.406
Can we still give you a little bit of those? Can we still do more of a contrast, commits and everything?

00:45:21.102 --> 00:45:23.102
Just… hm?

00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:23.525
Just…

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:28.088
just get things, right? Can we do that? It is possible, but it's complicated.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:28.470
It is possible, but it's complicated.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.450
You can do it, but you will lose a lot of things in the middle.

00:45:28.702 --> 00:45:31.702
You can do it, but you will lose a lot of things in the middle.

00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:36.467
Okay, so what… Especially if you are, like, more… more than one.

00:45:33.673 --> 00:45:36.673
So… Especially if you are, like, more… more than one.

00:45:37.105 --> 00:45:41.105
Yeah, I understand your point. So… so Git and GitHub, what is the difference?

00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:41.505
So, so Git and GitHub, what is the difference?

00:45:41.893 --> 00:45:43.893
Git and GitHub. GitHub is the bigger one.

00:45:42.424 --> 00:45:44.424
GitHub is the bigger one.

00:45:46.193 --> 00:45:51.193
like, a bigger good? Yeah, we're… yeah, I think you are not wrong, you're right.

00:45:46.575 --> 00:45:51.575
Yeah, we're…

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:55.890
I was thinking something else with it. This is the way that I understood that.

00:45:51.924 --> 00:45:55.924
I was thinking something else. This is the way that I understood the recording.

00:45:56.181 --> 00:45:59.181
You're not… you're not wrong, like, if you're able to explain, it's, uh, yeah.

00:45:59.349 --> 00:46:01.349
Because GitHub also uses Git.

00:45:59.774 --> 00:46:01.774
It was internal to use a stitch.

00:46:01.884 --> 00:46:04.884
So, I will consider, okay, it's the bigger kit.

00:46:02.014 --> 00:46:04.014
Yeah.

00:46:04.358 --> 00:46:09.358
But, okay, if you don't have data, can you create a report?

00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:08.969
But, okay, if you don't have GitHub, can you create a repo?

00:46:09.524 --> 00:46:13.524
And can you create a branch and do some commits on that?

00:46:10.048 --> 00:46:13.048
Initialize the repo, and can you create a branch and do some commits or not?

00:46:14.072 --> 00:46:16.072
If there's no GitHub, just GitHub.

00:46:14.123 --> 00:46:16.123
If there's look at her. Yeah.

00:46:15.924 --> 00:46:17.924
Yeah. You can do it right away, nice.

00:46:16.317 --> 00:46:18.317
Yeah.

00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:25.832
feature branch workflow. Get feature branch workflow, right? So, what is the benefit of it?

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:26.230
So, what is the benefit of it?

00:46:26.269 --> 00:46:29.269
The way you do tickets, what is the benefit of it?

00:46:26.692 --> 00:46:29.692
that the way you do tickets, what is the benefit of it?

00:46:30.575 --> 00:46:32.575
The way we do it tickets.

00:46:30.885 --> 00:46:32.885
the way we do tickets?

00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:34.666
creating a branch,

00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:35.151
creating a privilege.

00:46:34.885 --> 00:46:36.885
pull request, March…

00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:40.709
So, do you see any benefit? Yeah.

00:46:38.032 --> 00:46:41.032
Cool. So, do you see any benefit? Yeah.

00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:42.911
Like, uh…

00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:43.551
like, uh…

00:46:44.087 --> 00:46:51.087
As students, yeah, and here, uh, in Kwai. You are my team members, don't say students. Students sounds very bad. No, I mean anything.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:49.101
As students, yeah, and here, uh, in Quidline.

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.473
Okay. No, I mean, Annie.

00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:56.261
He's like me, right? I'm elect for here, for example.

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:56.342
You let me write, I'm elect for here, for example.

00:46:56.609 --> 00:47:06.609
Um, let's make you and the code owners make sure that… well, I mean, before we… I emerge, for example… Oh, I got your phone. Yeah, so checks and balances, right? For example?

00:46:57.332 --> 00:47:03.332
Um, it make you and the code owners make sure that what I mean, before we eye merge, for example,

00:47:04.046 --> 00:47:06.046
Yeah.

00:47:06.432 --> 00:47:12.432
Yeah. So there are checks. Yeah. It is a nice 20-minute point.

00:47:07.322 --> 00:47:15.322
So you don't merge directly to the main branch, so there are checks. Yeah. Which is a nice, very nice point, important point, right? Okay, let's jump to, uh, because time is short now.

00:47:13.775 --> 00:47:15.775
short-term.

00:47:15.798 --> 00:47:18.798
Right, let's jump to, uh, containerization, right?

00:47:16.324 --> 00:47:19.324
Alright, let's jump to, uh, containerization, right?

00:47:19.494 --> 00:47:22.494
So you have a virtual machine, and you have a container.

00:47:19.498 --> 00:47:25.498
So you have a virtual machine, and you have a container. Do you think there's a difference, or kind of the same thing?

00:47:23.305 --> 00:47:25.305
Do you think there's a difference, or kind of the same thing?

00:47:25.491 --> 00:47:27.491
a virtual machine and a container.

00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:27.947
Unfortunately, and a container.

00:47:28.153 --> 00:47:33.153
container where we can, uh, it's, like, similar to GitHub a little bit.

00:47:28.486 --> 00:47:30.486
Container where we can…

00:47:30.784 --> 00:47:33.784
It's, like, similar to GitHub, a little bit.

00:47:33.229 --> 00:47:38.229
Where you can save the work that you have done. And you can share its…

00:47:34.182 --> 00:47:37.182
Where you can see the work that you have done.

00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:41.717
And you can share its shareable for other users to use.

00:47:38.527 --> 00:47:41.527
shareable for other users to use.

00:47:42.597 --> 00:47:46.597
Okay, so… container, right? Container, you can… like, container, you can share.

00:47:42.628 --> 00:47:46.628
Continuation.

00:47:47.191 --> 00:47:51.191
In… yeah, like, you're skipping a lot of things, but yes, you can.

00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:51.565
Yeah. Yeah, like, you're skipping a lot of times, but yes, you can.

00:47:51.157 --> 00:47:53.157
Share images, actually, right?

00:47:51.614 --> 00:47:53.614
Share images at times, right?

00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:56.458
But it's fine, I'm trying to understand, right?

00:47:54.062 --> 00:47:57.062
It's fine, I'm trying to understand it.

00:47:58.061 --> 00:48:00.061
What is the difference between a Dockerfile?

00:47:58.094 --> 00:48:02.094
What is the difference between a Dockerfile, image, and a direct file?

00:48:00.054 --> 00:48:02.054
image and a container.

00:48:03.595 --> 00:48:07.595
Dockerfile image. And container. It's like, uh…

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.770
Duker file image. It's like, uh…

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.987
It's like… it's similar, similar to…

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:13.349
It's like… it's similar, similar to…

00:48:14.056 --> 00:48:16.056
to FAI, where you can access…

00:48:14.529 --> 00:48:16.529
to API, where you can access…

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:24.870
In other laptops, for example, or also it can save space, like, for example, not, like, 100 users can use.

00:48:16.923 --> 00:48:26.923
In other laptops, for example, or also it can save space, like, for example, not, like, 100 users can use. It can make you use, like,

00:48:25.243 --> 00:48:28.243
It can make you use, like, for example, it's, like, for…

00:48:27.203 --> 00:48:30.203
for example, it's, like, 4 computers, but from the same

00:48:28.782 --> 00:48:30.782
I'm the same that much.

00:48:30.795 --> 00:48:32.795
that image. Okay, can you…

00:48:31.168 --> 00:48:36.168
Okay, I understand. Maybe you're talking about something else, but what's a Docker image?

00:48:33.058 --> 00:48:35.058
You were posting on the bed?

00:48:35.134 --> 00:48:37.134
What's your look at communicating this?

00:48:36.495 --> 00:48:43.495
Just image. Yanni, like, what kind of does, like, it can run, it can deploy… Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:48:37.029 --> 00:48:42.029
does, like, it can run, it can deploy.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.120
Oh, negative.

00:48:44.344 --> 00:48:51.344
No, you're right. So, from the image, you can run a container, right? Yeah. From one image, can you run two containers?

00:48:45.279 --> 00:48:48.279
So, from the image, you can run a bacteria, right?

00:48:49.068 --> 00:48:51.068
Yeah. From bottom image, can you refer to condemnge?

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:53.695
I mean, remember from 1 to 3.

00:48:52.381 --> 00:48:56.381
Remember, from one image, right? Can you run two containers, or three, or 30, from one?

00:48:57.024 --> 00:48:59.024
Yeah. You can? Yes.

00:48:57.865 --> 00:48:59.865
Yeah. Yeah? Yes.

00:48:59.709 --> 00:49:01.709
Hi, sure. Yes, I'm sure.

00:49:00.343 --> 00:49:02.343
Yes, I'm sure.

00:49:03.242 --> 00:49:05.242
Okay, so…

00:49:03.866 --> 00:49:05.866
Okay, so…

00:49:06.609 --> 00:49:08.609
Docker Compose, right? So…

00:49:06.857 --> 00:49:08.857
So…

00:49:10.404 --> 00:49:13.404
Have you seen any benefit of Docker Compose lately?

00:49:10.615 --> 00:49:13.615
Have you seen any benefit of program tools lately?

00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:21.031
a user per hour.

00:49:19.385 --> 00:49:21.385
A user pet, you mean? Oh.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:26.370
Docker Confuse. Yeah. Like, for example, why do we use Docker Compose when we already have Docker?

00:49:21.834 --> 00:49:26.834
When we already have Docker?

00:49:26.754 --> 00:49:32.754
And we can just simply run commands multiple times and have multiple containers. Then why use docker Confuse?

00:49:27.162 --> 00:49:29.162
And we can just simply go…

00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:32.581
I watched multiple times, I have multiple containers. Then why is that?

00:49:34.773 --> 00:49:38.773
I mean, it's like… I'm not sure, like, exactly, but…

00:49:36.078 --> 00:49:39.078
Maybe it's, like… I'm not sure, like, exactly what's…

00:49:39.008 --> 00:49:44.008
Sure. It can help people on higher, uh, or people who can use more.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:44.260
it's… it can help people on higher level, or people who can use more.

00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:48.519
have more files, you know, have more users involved, like this, like…

00:49:44.976 --> 00:49:46.976
have more files, not have more…

00:49:46.982 --> 00:49:48.982
users, lick this, lick.

00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:50.862
It's the same thing, but on a higher lift.

00:49:49.324 --> 00:49:51.324
It's the same thing, but on a higher level.

00:49:52.778 --> 00:49:55.778
Okay, 9, okay, I got it right.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.160
This is Jenna again.

00:49:55.737 --> 00:49:57.737
Let's go to…

00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:02.699
When we say deployment, right? So you have deployment.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.160
Yeah, when we say deployment first, so we have to deploy…

00:50:02.903 --> 00:50:05.903
So, let's say if I tell you, Swayra that

00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:06.209
So, let's say if I tell you, Florida that…

00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:08.641
You have built the calculator application. Can you please deploy it?

00:50:07.007 --> 00:50:09.007
You have built a calculator application. Can you please deploy it?

00:50:08.807 --> 00:50:10.807
It's like running it.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.180
It's like running it.

00:50:11.225 --> 00:50:13.225
running it.

00:50:11.326 --> 00:50:13.326
running it.

00:50:13.682 --> 00:50:15.682
So, then what is hosting?

00:50:14.241 --> 00:50:16.241
So then, what is boosting? Hmm?

00:50:18.194 --> 00:50:21.194
Because I thought hosting was running the application, right?

00:50:18.572 --> 00:50:21.572
Because I thought hosting was running the application great.

00:50:21.253 --> 00:50:24.253
It's like distribute…

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:25.619
It's like distribut… not distributing.

00:50:24.895 --> 00:50:29.895
Yes, you are kind of, like, maybe you are… you cannot catch the word, but…

00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:30.306
Yes, you're kind of, like, maybe you are… you cannot catch the word, but…

00:50:29.767 --> 00:50:31.767
I mean…

00:50:30.436 --> 00:50:33.436
I mean, distributing…

00:50:32.492 --> 00:50:39.492
Distributing… maybe not exactly distributing, but something close. What's the meaning I mean? Yeah, yeah. Like, for example, if I say,

00:50:33.811 --> 00:50:37.811
maybe not exactly distributing, but something closer. What's the meaning, I mean?

00:50:40.025 --> 00:50:43.025
So, like, right now, your application is in your laptop, right?

00:50:40.843 --> 00:50:43.843
Sreenick, right now, the application is in your vector point.

00:50:43.728 --> 00:50:45.728
Can you please deploy your application?

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:46.007
Can you please deploy your application?

00:50:45.679 --> 00:50:48.679
So, what would you do? What would you understand from this?

00:50:46.213 --> 00:50:49.213
So what should we do? What could we do understand from this?

00:50:51.409 --> 00:50:53.409
Next.

00:50:51.546 --> 00:50:54.546
Next… like, I want to let…

00:50:53.852 --> 00:50:56.852
Look, I want to let others, Yanni.

00:50:55.256 --> 00:51:01.256
Is there any? Others access it? Yeah. Then what would you do for that?

00:50:57.876 --> 00:50:59.876
Yeah, there's X, is it? Yeah.

00:50:59.962 --> 00:51:01.962
then what would we do for that?

00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:05.893
You want your application to be accessible by others, so what do you do?

00:51:02.251 --> 00:51:06.251
I deploy you. You want your application to be accessible by others, so what do you want?

00:51:07.157 --> 00:51:11.157
For that. Yes, deploy, like, then deploy means?

00:51:07.452 --> 00:51:11.452
for the… Yes, deploy, like, the deploy means?

00:51:12.113 --> 00:51:17.113
You run your application where? In others. Like some other computer, right? Yeah. That is deployment.

00:51:12.474 --> 00:51:17.474
you run your application bit. And others. Yeah.

00:51:17.818 --> 00:51:23.818
Right? So you move your application from one place to another. This is what I meant when I told you, like, more than one laptop.

00:51:18.672 --> 00:51:24.672
to move your application from one place to another. This is what I meant when I told you, like, it's more than one laptop, right?

00:51:25.105 --> 00:51:27.105
Okay, okay. Okay. So…

00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:28.295
So…

00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:34.059
let's just second last, sort of, two more questions to me, but…

00:51:31.064 --> 00:51:34.064
Let's just second ask, sort of, two more questions.

00:51:34.667 --> 00:51:36.667
It's actually… it's one hour already.

00:51:35.172 --> 00:51:37.172
It's actually a one hour already.

00:51:36.913 --> 00:51:38.913
Already? I am asking.

00:51:37.362 --> 00:51:39.362
I'm asking.

00:51:39.404 --> 00:51:41.404
Uh, no, there's this time left.

00:51:39.717 --> 00:51:41.717
Interesting.

00:51:41.642 --> 00:51:44.642
But anyways, so let's quickly do it, right?

00:51:43.031 --> 00:51:45.031
So, let's quickly do it quick.

00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:55.066
So, what are you doing? You are trying to evaluate yourself in our overall? Yeah, because we don't have much time, that's why I was asking. I think 5-10 minutes might be the minimum.

00:51:46.443 --> 00:51:54.443
So, what do you… you're trying to evaluate your son, if this man over? No, no, because you said we don't have much time, that's why… that's why I was asking.

00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:56.989
Okay.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.045
Then we have Muslim text.

00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:59.049
So, uh…

00:51:57.306 --> 00:51:59.306
So, um…

00:51:59.977 --> 00:52:03.977
I was actually trying to ask you about CICD actually.

00:52:00.127 --> 00:52:04.127
Uh, I was actually trying to ask you about CICT.

00:52:04.858 --> 00:52:07.858
Yeah. So recently, you have been hearing a lot about CICT,

00:52:04.908 --> 00:52:07.908
Yeah. So, you said that you have been hearing a lot about CIC.

00:52:08.609 --> 00:52:10.609
Jenkins, uh…

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.928
You know how good to play it.

00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:14.959
you know how to deploy an application, I think, manually.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.140
application, I think.

00:52:16.075 --> 00:52:18.075
And CICD…

00:52:16.902 --> 00:52:18.902
NCICD.

00:52:18.812 --> 00:52:24.812
What does CIZ actually do with the deployment? It has something to do with the deployment, what's that? Uh, it's like…

00:52:19.525 --> 00:52:21.525
What does CSG?

00:52:22.613 --> 00:52:25.613
It has something to do with the development, what's that?

00:52:25.712 --> 00:52:27.712
It's like…

00:52:26.324 --> 00:52:29.324
If you want to change or to update something.

00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:31.762
If you want to change or to update something,

00:52:29.824 --> 00:52:31.824
This is the way.

00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:34.233
This is the way, like…

00:52:32.268 --> 00:52:34.268
change or updates sometime.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.050
Yeah. Um…

00:52:38.344 --> 00:52:42.344
Like, if you want to, like, update.

00:52:40.733 --> 00:52:43.733
No changes, don't change the way. Like, if you want to, like, update

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:45.792
something… like, if you are using virgin…

00:52:43.914 --> 00:52:46.914
something… look, if you are using Virgin…

00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:48.721
Like, if it's… I understand your point. So, for example, if you want to…

00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:49.706
Like, if it's…

00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:55.609
release a new version of your application, right? Yeah. But that you can do without CICD also. I have done it in front of me many times. By CSD.

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:56.450
Yeah. But that you can move without CAC.

00:52:57.115 --> 00:53:01.115
Because you are very smart. I'm not registered.

00:52:57.416 --> 00:53:01.416
Because you are very smart and stuff.

00:53:01.415 --> 00:53:06.415
What is the LCV? Believe me, you are more smarter than me, because, uh, when I was…

00:53:01.985 --> 00:53:05.985
YCICB? Believe me, you are more smarter than me, because, uh, when I was…

00:53:06.965 --> 00:53:10.965
At your place, I knew nothing. I wish I knew something, but I was…

00:53:07.353 --> 00:53:11.353
at your place, I didn't nothing. I wish I knew something, but I wasn't…

00:53:11.797 --> 00:53:14.797
That's it.

00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:14.227
I knew nothing. I was a good problem solver, that's it.

00:53:15.033 --> 00:53:23.033
Nothing else. Like, here, I can do something more, but, you know, no, I couldn't. Logic… logic is here, more. If you can do something here,

00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:23.381
Like, here, I can do something more with you, no, I cannot. Because here, logic is here, more. If you can do something here…

00:53:23.193 --> 00:53:27.193
There's only something holding you back, but you are capable of doing everything.

00:53:23.498 --> 00:53:27.498
There's only something we can go back, but you are capable of doing everything.

00:53:27.354 --> 00:53:30.354
So, it's all about capability. You are capable,

00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:30.811
Okay. It's all about capability. You are capable,

00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:37.291
But for some reason, you didn't spend that much time, so that's why. Otherwise, uh… Or maybe we have done…

00:53:31.377 --> 00:53:34.377
But for some reason, you… you didn't spend that much time, so that's why.

00:53:34.746 --> 00:53:39.746
Otherwise, uh… Or maybe we have done… we have not done more, uh, projects, so…

00:53:38.334 --> 00:53:40.334
We have not done more projects, so…

00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:43.789
practicing it would be… Yeah, but relatively…

00:53:40.994 --> 00:53:43.994
practicing it would make a difference.

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:48.770
We can compare relatively, right? Like, for example, if someone is able to, like, do everything,

00:53:44.678 --> 00:53:47.678
We can update everything through. For example, if someone is able to…

00:53:49.173 --> 00:53:56.173
So, imagine there's another person who's not from a computer science background,

00:53:49.756 --> 00:53:59.756
And not even from the computer science background, you are not from computer science background, right? So, imagine there's another person who's not from computer science background, and is able to understand everything, which means you have not done something right.

00:53:56.357 --> 00:54:00.357
And it's even focused on everything, which means you have not done something right.

00:54:00.251 --> 00:54:03.251
Maybe. Or it's not your fault, maybe?

00:54:00.753 --> 00:54:03.753
But it's not your fault, maybe?

00:54:04.013 --> 00:54:09.013
Because every person has a different way of understanding, and they cannot understand… they have different styles of learning.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:09.460
Because every person has a different way of understanding, and they cannot understand. They have different styles of learning.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.970
Yeah. It's not personal. Yeah. I agree with you.

00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:12.248
I agree with you.

00:54:12.233 --> 00:54:16.233
But actually, what can we do? Unfortunately, we have limited resources, so we just

00:54:12.656 --> 00:54:16.656
But actually, what can we do? Unfortunately, we have limited resources, so we just…

00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:19.101
We judge everyone by, can you please climb the tree?

00:54:17.453 --> 00:54:19.453
We touch everyone by, can you please climb the tree?

00:54:19.834 --> 00:54:24.834
Right, so… they're false. Anyways, so, uh, CIC, right?

00:54:19.897 --> 00:54:22.897
Anyways…

00:54:23.123 --> 00:54:30.123
So, excuse me, right? What is the benefit? What you see? Releasing new versions can also fit in an automatic, right?

00:54:24.669 --> 00:54:29.669
Uh, what is… what is the benefit? What you say? Releasing new versions can also be done manually, right?

00:54:30.249 --> 00:54:32.249
So, what does CICD do for us?

00:54:30.566 --> 00:54:32.566
So what does CACD do for us?

00:54:32.583 --> 00:54:34.583
Continuous integration, continuous delivery.

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.769
Then disintegration continuously.

00:54:38.455 --> 00:54:40.455
Is it, like, related? A deployment.

00:54:38.844 --> 00:54:40.844
Is it, like, related to… Department.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.790
You know, I mean, like, uh…

00:54:41.961 --> 00:54:43.961
Yeah, you know, I mean, like, uh…

00:54:44.466 --> 00:54:51.466
another languages like VS, like this, yeah? Not languages, that's general… generally, general deployment, actually.

00:54:45.357 --> 00:54:48.357
not the languages like BS, like this, Yanni. Okay.

00:54:49.113 --> 00:54:51.113
Generally to tender requirement.

00:54:53.111 --> 00:54:55.111
We're trying, okay, let's move to AI agents.

00:54:54.255 --> 00:54:59.255
Very exciting. Let's move to AI agents. Uh, what do you think when you hear the word AI agents?

00:54:55.893 --> 00:54:58.893
So, you know. Uh, what do you think when you hear the word AI agents?

00:54:59.022 --> 00:55:01.022
Versus large language models.

00:54:59.566 --> 00:55:01.566
Versus large magnet portals.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.160
Like, for example, I want to ask you, what is the difference between a chat GPT?

00:55:02.348 --> 00:55:05.348
What is the difference between a chat GPT?

00:55:05.232 --> 00:55:07.232
and an AI agent.

00:55:07.735 --> 00:55:11.735
Yeah, an AI agent is, like, for example, using ChatGPT.

00:55:07.976 --> 00:55:17.976
Yeah, our agent is, like, for example, using ChatGPT or RAN. Yeah, nice, yeah. Not 100% correct, yes, then. Yeah, something that… it depends on what are you doing.

00:55:11.815 --> 00:55:13.815
Hold on. Yeah?

00:55:14.508 --> 00:55:21.508
Yeah, so something that… it depends on what are you doing exactly. Let's say if you use a strategy, and then what…

00:55:18.024 --> 00:55:22.024
Let's say it uses ChatGPT, and then what can it do?

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.750
After it uses charging.

00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:28.742
After it uses ChatGPT. You just tell him what exactly should he do, even the way he thinks, the way he did, uh, giving…

00:55:23.998 --> 00:55:28.998
you just tell him what exactly should he do, even the way he thinks, the way he did, uh, giving…

00:55:29.741 --> 00:55:31.741
Can AI Agent pull your APIs?

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.070
just, uh…

00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:34.091
Hmm? Can AI agent call…

00:55:32.514 --> 00:55:34.514
NEA agent bought it.

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:36.765
an API, or read a file, or…

00:55:35.212 --> 00:55:37.212
an idiot, or read a file, or…

00:55:37.749 --> 00:55:39.749
do something else.

00:55:38.315 --> 00:55:40.315
do something else.

00:55:40.652 --> 00:55:43.652
Yeah, it can do, but depends on what have you told them to do.

00:55:41.077 --> 00:55:44.077
Yeah, it's kind of both depends on what have you told him to do.

00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:45.652
No, you're right.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:53.250
That I will tell you later, right?

00:55:50.255 --> 00:55:53.255
why there are, uh…

00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:58.476
But red doesn't mean, like, completely wrong, right? Like, partially, okay.

00:55:55.433 --> 00:55:57.433
a little fresh.

00:55:57.628 --> 00:56:00.628
Like, partially, okay. But they're little frets. Yeah.

00:55:58.843 --> 00:56:03.843
But they're little friends. Yeah, but thank you, Sunila. So, I will just, uh, save the transcript.
