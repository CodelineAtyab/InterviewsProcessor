00:00:02.423 --> 00:00:08.423
Okay, so we are going to just discuss, like, a few things. This is a scoring 15-20 minutes, hopefully.

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:07.844
Okay, so if you're going to just, uh, discuss, uh, quite a few things.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.970
But I… I'm…

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:17.197
I'm seeing a pattern, it's going longer than expected. Nice. Uh, Python-based, uh, you know, networking basics.

00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:12.084
I'm seeing a bet.

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:19.423
Python-based layouts, you know, networking-based, VM basics, Linux basics, Git,

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.004
VM basics, Linux Basics, get proper basics.

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:23.088
Doctor V6. Uh, things I've written down.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.620
Uh, things that have been done here.

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:25.638
So, let's just start with…

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:26.196
So, let's just start with some…

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.426
Python business. Maybe I will skip things, Muzno.

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.481
Python business. Maybe I will skip things, Mujano.

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.733
Maybe, right? Maybe jump directly to advanced Python.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.905
Maybe, right? Maybe jump directly to advanced Python, or maybe…

00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:38.571
Or maybe intermediate problem solving. So, let's say you have a list of numbers, right? 1, 1, 2, 2.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:39.134
intermediate problem solving. So, let's say you have a list of numbers, right? Yes. 1, 1, 2…

00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:40.843
Doom.

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:42.052
2, and let's say…

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:42.937
let's say, 3…

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.566
3… 3 and 4, and let's say 5. Mm-hmm.

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:45.758
3 and 4, and also 5.

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:48.784
So, all of them are separate numbers.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
So, all of them are separate numbers, right? Yes.

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:56.306
So, and you don't have to write the code, you can just explain your logic, or write whatever you like.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.539
So, and you don't have to write the code, you can just text me in your logic, or you can write whatever you like.

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:03.632
You want to write a Python script that can actually dig a list of numbers as input?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:09.060
You want to write a Python script that can actually take a list of numbers as input. Now, the numbers can repeat, but they will always repeat.

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:08.854
Uh, now the numbers can't repeat, but they will always repeat

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:10.947
In order, like, one after another.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.261
In order, like, one after another.

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.041
You will not find one here and one here.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:13.395
You will not find one here and one here.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:22.829
Right? Yes. They will repeat in consecutive to each other, right? Like, 1-1, then there might be multiple tools, there might be 3, or 4, or 5. What I have to do…

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:23.457
Right? Yes. They will repeat in consecutive to each other. Like, one month, then there might be multiple tools, there might be 3, or 4, or 5. What I have to do…

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:25.945
I have to write a logic that gives me this…

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.259
I have to write a logic that gives me this…

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.792
Back.

00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:32.254
Okay. Some presses the…

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:35.988
compresses the repeated numbers. Like, consider them only once. Okay. What would be your logic?

00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:37.588
a repeated numbers. Like, consider them only once. Okay. What would be your logic, actually, for them? Okay…

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:38.283
Okay.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:40.263
First, there will be a loop.

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:40.589
See, first, there will be a loop.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:50.142
Okay, then after the loop, that will go one by one here, one by one, so there will be an if condition. Okay. That will check. So, uh…

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Okay, then after the loop, that will go one by one here, one by one, see? There will be an if- Okay. That will check.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.253
So, uh…

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:52.297
What will you do for the first item?

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:52.787
What will you do for the first item?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.070
So, yeah, only…

00:01:53.323 --> 00:02:01.323
Yeah, I will have, uh, like, a variable that will hold the first, uh, the first one, like, uh, list.

00:01:56.072 --> 00:02:01.072
The first, uh, the first one. Like, uh, list.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:08.416
Uh, which has the indexed one. Let's just the other one. Yeah? The old one. Because it will go in the loop.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Uh, which has played on here. Yeah. The old one. Because it will go in the loop?

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.874
Then it would start from here, uh…

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:12.158
Then, it will start from here, uh…

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.069
Like, if… from here, if this X… No, let's write the code, just tell me the logic. Okay, yeah.

00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:17.347
Like, if… from here, if this X… You want to write the code, just tell me the literature. Okay, yeah.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.879
Yeah. Is it? Uh, so, uh, the X will com… it will be like the…

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:22.975
Is it? Uh, so, uh, the X will conf… it will be like the

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:24.944
doing the whole…

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:30.183
then when the hold, the first number, then after that, we'll… there will be an if condition that will compare.

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:34.089
Person number 4, then after that, there will be an addition that will compare… An X number. Yeah, 1.1. So, uh, and we will have a new list.

00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:37.198
Yeah, 1.1. So, uh, and we will have a new list, okay? Uh, that list, uh…

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.759
Okay, uh, that list, uh…

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:38.767
It would be empty, okay?

00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:43.388
It would be empty, okay? Uh, that will append, like, after this, uh,

00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:43.141
Uh, that would happen after this, uh, if…

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:52.210
will, uh, work. It will append. If the first one… it'll go, then if it is, like, there will be a minimums.

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:49.426
will, uh, work, it will append. If the first one, yeah, it'll go, then

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.462
If it is, like, there would be a minimum, something related.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:03.540
Okay, for example, let's say you have this one, right? Let's say you move to the next one. You compare with X, and let's say the conversion is false. So, if it's false, then…

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.325
Okay, for example, let's say you have this one, right? Yep.

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.429
let's say we move to the next one. You compare with X, and let's say the conversion is false.

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:04.011
So, if it's false, then…

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.950
Or what will happen if it's true?

00:03:04.286 --> 00:03:06.286
Or what will happen if it's true?

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:11.583
So, yeah, there is a document condition. If it is true, then it is, like, ugh.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:12.083
So, yeah, there is a different condition. If it is true, then it is locked.

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:16.306
True and false. Okay, if it's true, that mean is this, like…

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:20.566
True and false. Okay, if it's true, that mean is less… give me a second to… X? This is not lessen greater, this is not…

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:27.021
And give me a second to… there's not less and greater, this is, like, compressing. So, you have to escape, you have to ignore the repeated element, right? You have to ignore, right? Yes, yes. You don't have to find minimum or maximum.

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:27.345
compressing. So, you have to escape, you have to include the repeated elements, right? You have to ignore, right? You don't have to find minimum or maximum.

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:28.965
Yeah, but this is…

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:29.446
Yeah, but this is…

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:39.490
like, this is a perfect case, because we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we have, for example… And it will always be like this. Okay. Yeah, no need to complicate the logic. Yes. It's going to be like this.

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:34.814
like, this is a perfect case, because we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… we have, for example… It will always be like this.

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:39.626
Okay. Yeah, no need to complicate the logic. Yes. It's going to be like this.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.790
So, if it is like X, do we skip this and go to another. If it's not equal, if it's not equal to that, then change this.

00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:48.223
So, if it is like X, do we skip this and go to another. If it's not equal, if it's not equal to that, then change this.

00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:55.463
to another, uh, to this, for example, for two, for example, index agree on here 0, that would be 3, uh, 2.

00:03:48.565 --> 00:04:04.565
to another, uh, to this, for example, for two, for example, index B, I'm here 0, that would be 3, uh, 2. Okay. The index, so to start to compare, if it's the same, skip it, skip it, then, uh, we have the 3, then we update this, and we end it here.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:05.379
Okay. The index, so it just starts to compare if it's the same, skip it, skip it, then we have C3, then we update this, and we add here.

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:08.507
It's gonna…

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:16.126
Okay. Okay, moving on, let's say you are building an application, right? For Musna, we will take tic-tac-toe.

00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:16.535
Okay, Nisha, let's say you are building an application, right? For Musra, we will take tech-tech.

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:19.179
For other people in the first… okay.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.855
Let's say yes.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:25.884
So let's say… maybe… okay, let's say specific. So, you are building a tech-tech application, but you are actually building

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:26.188
Maybe… okay, let's say specific. So, you are building a cryptic application, but you are actually building

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:31.536
Uh, the score motive score. Yes. So you're… you need to store the score.

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.689
Uh, the score module score. Yes, the score. So you need to score the score.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:39.043
And the things that you can… the data structures that you can use to store this score are either a dictionary,

00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:34.153
Yes. And…

00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:39.328
the things that you can… the data structures that you can use to store this for are either a dictionary,

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:46.425
For either a list. Yes. Don't forget about storing in a file right now. Yes. Just, uh, think about storing it either in a list or a dictionary, right?

00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:46.694
Okay. Either a list. Yes. Don't forget about the storage in a file right now. Yes. Just, uh, think about storing it either in a list or a dictionary, right?

00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:50.481
But remember, this tic-tac-to is played by

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:50.583
But remember, uh, this trick-tact was created by…

00:04:50.897 --> 00:04:56.897
This is a multiplayer game, and it's played by thousands of people, thousands of people. Yes. Right? And, uh…

00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:55.338
It's played by thousands of people, thousands of people. Yes.

00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:57.346
Right? And, uh…

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.210
Um, so you have a lot of score coming in. Yes. Maybe… maybe 100 records per second.

00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:03.394
Um, so you have a lot of school coming in. Yes. Maybe, maybe 100 records per second.

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:05.275
Yes. So…

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:05.501
Yes, so…

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:10.007
How would you like to store the score? Do you like to store the score in a list?

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:10.375
How would you like to store this food? Do you like to store this pool in a list?

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.751
or a dictionary? Yes, I understand. Sorry.

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.321
Or a dictionary? Yes, I understand. So…

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:17.126
there will be two things, like the ID of the user,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.620
There will be two things, like the ID of the user,

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:26.068
Lecture not to worry about ID or anything, right? Let's just say number. A number is coming, it's cool. Of course, with a score, you have… let's say there's a string.

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:32.004
Let's not worry about ID or anything, right? Let's just say number. A number is coming, score. Of course, with the score, you have… let's say there's a string. It's a comma-separated string, like, have everything, don't worry about it, right? Would you prefer a list or a dictionary? Just…

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:31.773
It's a comma-separated string, like, have everything, don't worry about it, right? Would you prefer a list or a dictionary?

00:05:32.588 --> 00:05:34.588
you have to say either list or dictionary.

00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:34.591
You have to say I understand it, Shane.

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:37.791
For this case, I think a dictionary is the best.

00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:37.288
For this case, I think it's dictionary is the best.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:45.629
Uh, so, again, remember, what we are doing, we are actually extremely, like, continuously, like, hundreds of reports per second we are writing, right?

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:45.917
Uh, so, again, remember, what we are doing, we are actually extremely, continuously, like, hundreds of… I dig, yes.

00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.631
And… Not reading.

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:47.885
Not reading.

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:53.045
We are actually writing hundreds of records per second, so do you… do you prefer using a list?

00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:50.545
We are actually writing hundreds of reports per second.

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.121
So, do you… do you prefer using a list?

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:57.616
or a dictionary, which, in terms of performance, like, what would perform better in this case?

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.729
On our dictionary, which, in terms of performance, like, what would perform better in this case?

00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:10.287
Lists should be better in adding the abandoning to the list. Okay. So, to be fast for adding to the list. Yeah, if someone wants to find this code, then what will be your choice? Dictionary, because we are using a half.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.409
lists would be better in adding the appending L2 list.

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:11.576
So, it would be fast for adding to the list. If someone wants to find this code, then what will be your choice? Dictionary, because we are using a hash. Okay, good, nice.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.219
Okay, good, nice. Right? So…

00:06:12.183 --> 00:06:17.183
Right? So, you have a… you have seen this multiple times.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.200
You have seen this multiple times, right? Like, you have seen this name magic variable.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Like, you have seen this name magic variable.

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:23.682
multiple times. Usually, it's double equal to main, right?

00:06:21.073 --> 00:06:24.073
multiple times. It's the main, right?

00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:26.306
Yeah.

00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:26.848
Yeah.

00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:29.984
So… okay.

00:06:28.553 --> 00:06:30.553
So… okay.

00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:32.842
And if condition, right? For example,

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.191
And if condition, right? For example?

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:38.718
Let's say I have A.PY, A.PY, and I have B.py.

00:06:34.702 --> 00:06:36.702
let's say I have A.PY,

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.059
A dot PY, and I have B.PY.

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:43.162
BY, uh, both have this condition, right? Yes.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:43.842
Both have this condition, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:06:43.854 --> 00:06:45.854
But for B.PY,

00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:46.058
But for B.PY,

00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:52.311
After this condition, I will just write F, after this condition, there is, let's say, ID equal to…

00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.731
After this condition, I will just write F. After this condition, there is

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:52.727
let's say ID equal to…

00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:54.697
1, 2, 3 fibs into the right.

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.375
1, 2, 3, for example, right? Mm-hmm.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
And in A.PY,

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.882
And in A.PY,

00:06:57.744 --> 00:06:59.744
I'm actually importing.

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.969
I'm actually importing.

00:07:00.134 --> 00:07:02.134
B dot P1.

00:07:00.512 --> 00:07:02.512
B dot P1.

00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:04.285
import B.P, right?

00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:04.778
import B.P, right? Mm-hmm.

00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:07.877
And then I try to do B.it.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.079
And then I try to do V.ID.

00:07:09.726 --> 00:07:11.726
Would this work, or would this not work?

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:14.015
Would this work, or would this not work? And if it doesn't work, why it doesn't work?

00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:14.456
And if it doesn't work, why it doesn't work? Sit.

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.268
Yeah. First of all, this line?

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:20.533
First of all, this line will work. For example, if we run this…

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:20.646
When work, for example, if we run this…

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.539
We will have it. Locally. Okay. Okay. But…

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:25.593
We will have it locally. Okay. But this…

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:31.813
This will not… will… we have no idea that this is existing. Okay. In this file, because this is running locally,

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:30.422
will not… will not… we have no idea that this is existing. Okay. In this file.

00:07:30.307 --> 00:07:32.307
Because this is running locally,

00:07:32.847 --> 00:07:34.847
And, uh, will not appear here.

00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:35.026
And, uh, will not appear here.

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:39.941
Locally, by locally, you mean, like, when I do BDR directly? Yes.

00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:40.343
Because locally, by locally, you mean, like, when I… when we don't pivot directly, you mean? Yes.

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.917
Okay, okay, yeah.

00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:42.328
Okay, yeah.

00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:47.652
So… okay, now, now think about it, right? I… we have, uh…

00:07:43.943 --> 00:07:47.943
So… okay, now, now think about it, right? I… we have, uh…

00:07:47.996 --> 00:07:49.996
We have…

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:50.365
Uh, we have…

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.526
Uh, so many projects in Python, right?

00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:52.885
Uh, so many projections, right?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.610
And we are using Python virtual environment, right? Yes.

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.969
And we are using Python virtual environment, right? Yes.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.860
So, what do you think is the reason for using that virtual environment?

00:07:56.532 --> 00:08:07.532
So, what do you think is the reason for using the virtual environment? Virtual… because… Why don't we just destroy Python in our C drive? We already have Python. Yes. Why don't we just use it? Why…

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:07.469
Why don't we just destroy Python in our C drive? We already have Python, right? Why don't we just use it? Why…

00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:09.523
go for alternate final.

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:10.022
go for virtual environment.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:15.155
Okay, uh, we use the virtual environment for each

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:19.624
Okay, uh, use the virtual environment for each app, because each app have different dependency. So, uh…

00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:20.131
up, because each app have different dependency, so, uh…

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:23.732
dependencies. Yes, as you can… as you say, that, uh, it's…

00:08:20.782 --> 00:08:32.782
Yes, as you can… as you say, that, uh, it would be a headache to install each one and install a different version for every application. So we use the virtual environment for each application to

00:08:24.481 --> 00:08:31.481
beheading to install each one and install a different version for every application. So we used the virtual environment for each

00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:33.496
Patient 2 works with…

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.179
work smoothly, without any…

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:39.165
Without a leave. So, are you sure it's just…

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
Installing the dependency each time?

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:43.454
So, are you sure it's just, like, okay, not just, but one of the reasons is because dependency can… Yes.

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:44.256
Like, okay, not just, but one of the reasons is because dependency concepts can be there, are you sure?

00:08:43.572 --> 00:08:45.572
Are you sure?

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.930
Well, yes.

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:56.875
You know, we have discussed, yeah, we have discussed many times

00:08:54.202 --> 00:08:59.202
You know, we have discussed… yeah, we have discussed many times the server application and the client application, right? Yes.

00:08:57.825 --> 00:08:59.825
the server application and the client application, right? Yes.

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:04.548
Um, uh, what is the relationship between a server application and an API endpoint?

00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:04.826
What is the relationship between a server application and an API endpoint?

00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:10.273
Several… Server? Application and an API endpoint.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.550
So, servo? Application, and then API endpoint.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.690
Okay, we have Abe. API. P.I. Okay, okay, yeah.

00:09:11.078 --> 00:09:23.078
We have Abe? Abe. T-I. Okay, okay, yeah. And server. Several application. What is the relationship? Like, how they are two related?

00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:22.331
Like it. You have a… okay. And server. What is the relationship like?

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:30.549
Okay. So, I think the server can act like an API.

00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:30.349
So, I think the server can act like an API.

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:32.858
Like, getting the request.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320
Like, getting the request.

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:35.775
Okay. Okay, yeah.

00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:35.927
Okay? Okay, yeah.

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:41.129
Uh… So, for example, if, uh…

00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:41.272
Uh… So, for example, if, uh…

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:46.122
if I have an application that has an API endpoint, so…

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:46.381
If I have an application that has an API endpoint, so…

00:09:46.868 --> 00:09:48.868
it just becomes server application, or…?

00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:49.176
It just becomes a replication, or…

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:52.175
The ABI cannot reasserb our application.

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:52.489
The AVI cannot be a server application.

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:54.169
Because…

00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:54.462
Because…

00:09:54.684 --> 00:10:01.684
Well, I'm still… there's a confuse here. Think about it. Take your time, then answer.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:58.646
I'm still… there's confuse here.

00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:00.988
Think about it. Shake your time.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.001
Yes.

00:10:14.327 --> 00:10:16.327
Well, I'm sorry, I'm not sure…

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:16.626
Well, I'm not sure.

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:18.927
Okay, so, uh…

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.220
Okay, so, uh…

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.780
a server application, right? Let's talk about… we are talking about actually a web server. Yep.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.910
a server application, right? Let's talk about… we are talking about a clear web server. Yep.

00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:27.066
Right? A web server application like Past APIs.

00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:27.503
Right, a web server application like FastRate Theater.

00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:29.295
Yes. Wait till…

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.726
Yes. Excellent.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:33.613
Uh, if you… if you are writing a server application,

00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:33.617
Uh, if you… if you are writing this server application.

00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:41.812
Is it a must to have at least one API endor, or is it not a must to have at least one API endpoint? Like, the server… the web server application?

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:38.738
Is it a must to have at least one API input, or is it not a must to have at least one?

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:42.125
API endpoint. Like, the server… the web server application?

00:10:42.564 --> 00:10:46.564
should have an API endpoint, or can you just get away without an API endpoint?

00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:50.141
should have an AP endpoint, or can just get away with an API endpoint? The server can work without an ABI.

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:51.548
Let's… the server can work without an AVI. Without an API, okay? Yes.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:52.025
without an AP, okay? Yes.

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:55.089
Uh, so… so then, uh…

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.303
Uh, so… so… and, uh…

00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:57.719
Okay, so let's say now I have a script.

00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:58.061
Okay, so let's now… I have a script.

00:10:57.803 --> 00:11:00.803
Yes. That has an API endpoint that can actually

00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:01.123
Yes. That has an API endpoint that can actually…

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.536
take requests. Yes.

00:11:01.892 --> 00:11:03.892
take requests. Yes.

00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:06.624
So, should I call that script a server application or not?

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:06.815
So, should I call that escape a server application or not?

00:11:07.806 --> 00:11:09.806
Or not.

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:10.244
Or not.

00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:11.886
Okay, the scripts… Yes or no?

00:11:10.098 --> 00:11:12.098
Okay, a script? Yes or no?

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:18.563
No. No, so it accepts requests, but I cannot call it a server application.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:18.939
No. I don't… I don't think so. It accepts requests?

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:32.959
Uh… maybe we can… We'll come back to it later, okay, so let's move forward. Okay, what is the difference between a client application and a server application?

00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:28.444
Uh… maybe we can, because it is…

00:11:29.298 --> 00:11:33.298
What is the difference between a client application and a server application?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.090
We have a server and client. Application. What is the difference, like…

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.550
So, you have a server and client. What is the difference, like?

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:46.398
Okay, the client will request the server. Okay. Okay? The server will give the client

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.600
Okay, the client will request the server, okay? The server will give the client

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:48.407
The… Response. Response.

00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.741
The response.

00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:53.372
Yes. But inside the server application, what actually handles the request?

00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:53.811
Yes. But inside the server application, what actually handles the request?

00:11:56.672 --> 00:12:01.672
So, let's jump back to the API and pointing, right?

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:06.297
There you go. Yes. Does the South African must have at least 20%? Yes.

00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:06.065
Yes. Does the sub-application must have at least one API in front of it? Yes.

00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:08.968
Okay, you're right.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.279
Okay. I can hear you alright.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:19.129
That's cool. Okay, when we are talking about client and server, let's say your tic-tac-toe application is a server application, and so many people are, let's say, using it, right?

00:12:09.869 --> 00:12:15.869
That's cool. Okay, when we are talking about client and server, let's say your tic-tac-to application is a server application,

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:19.636
And so many people are, let's say, using it, right?

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.750
you have to… you have already stored this code in a list.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.930
you have to… you have already screwed the score in a list.

00:12:23.685 --> 00:12:26.685
Okay, yes. Right? But the problem is if the application exits.

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:27.006
Okay, yes? But the problem is if the application accepts.

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:31.617
I guess. If it exerts and you redone it again. Zero. Then there's…

00:12:27.932 --> 00:12:31.932
Yes. Zero. Then there's…

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960
Would there be something stored or not?

00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:34.475
Would there be something strong or not? Nope.

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:42.192
Right, so how… how would you make it persistent? How would you make sure that we don't lose the data? Like, what would be your approach solving this?

00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:38.153
Great, so how… how would you make it persistent? How would you make sure that…

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:42.745
you don't lose the return. Like, what would be your approach solving this?

00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:44.703
Persistence issue. Cool.

00:12:43.851 --> 00:12:45.851
persistence issue. We can't…

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:46.604
You can't…

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:48.039
Uh… okay.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:56.601
Okay. One option is saving in the archive, like a JST file, uh, that will write in it using the file.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:53.151
One option is, like, saving it in a file, like a JSON file.

00:12:53.288 --> 00:12:57.288
Uh, that will write in it using the file?

00:12:56.789 --> 00:12:58.789
Uh…

00:12:57.605 --> 00:12:59.605
Uh…

00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:03.942
If we only look at it, but we can see, we can use, for example,

00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:05.365
if we don't even located, but we can't say, we can't use, for example, database.

00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:09.062
If you want to have something, like, XU…

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.240
If we have something bigger, like my XU…

00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.876
No, no, no, no, I understand your point, okay, good.

00:13:10.433 --> 00:13:12.433
I understand your point, okay.

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.419
My supervisor.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:18.030
Okay, so…

00:13:15.556 --> 00:13:22.556
Okay, so, since we are talking about your network application rate, so…

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.970
Since we are talking about, uh, your network application, so…

00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:25.181
I mean, uh…

00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:25.534
I mean, uh…

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.555
And you said client can send a request for server, right? Yes.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.670
a new state client concerns under the control server, right? Yes.

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:30.432
Um, so…

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:30.662
Um, so…

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:34.026
if a client wants to send a request,

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:35.834
if a client wants to send a request, what does it need to know?

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.990
What does it need to know?

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:38.569
Uh, about the… Which labels the client.

00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:38.953
Uh, about the… Which enables the climb?

00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:41.528
We will send a request, right? What does it need to know? To me.

00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:41.754
to send a request, right? What does it need to know? Domain.

00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:44.101
Uh, or address, right?

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:44.677
Uh, or address, right? Yes, or IP address.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.370
what is the… what is the relation between IPOX and the pool?

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.533
what is the… what is the relation between an IP address and a port?

00:13:49.022 --> 00:13:51.022
And poor. Okay.

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:54.427
Okay, so the IP address, the server would have one IP address.

00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:54.191
The IP address, the server would have one IV address.

00:13:54.713 --> 00:13:58.713
Okay? The boards will… like…

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.770
Okay? The ports will… that… the door, like…

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720
The door, the, like…

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.180
Okay, let's send you something, brilliant.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.360
Okay, let's say the server is running… I will help you out, right?

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.275
I will help you operate.

00:14:05.004 --> 00:14:08.004
If the server is running technical applications, right?

00:14:05.837 --> 00:14:10.837
If this server is running multiple applications, right? Can more than one application have the same program?

00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:10.669
Can more than one application have the same protocol on it?

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:13.516
Right. So, okay, good.

00:14:11.654 --> 00:14:13.654
So, okay, good.

00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:15.918
Can the server have more than one IP address or not?

00:14:14.276 --> 00:14:16.276
Can the server have more than one IP address or not?

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.670
Once a… mhm.

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:19.455
Do you want several?

00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:25.551
I think he's gone, but… It's good. Are you sure?

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:25.829
I think, yes, he's gone, but I don't… It's good. It's gone. I should.

00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.541
Yes or no?

00:14:26.072 --> 00:14:28.072
Yes or no? Ehh…

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.900
I think I… the more…

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:39.386
I think, I mean, the more… it's no, but I think it can be… Because I haven't followed it, so… Yeah, I think it's…

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:39.375
It's no, but I think it can be. Because I haven't covered it, so…

00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:44.581
For now, for my knowledge, it's one, but I think people can't do it too.

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:42.658
For now, for my knowledge, it's one, but I think…

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.460
People too. Okay, so, for example,

00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:49.181
For example, maybe you have seen me access the Gateway browser, right? Yes.

00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:49.025
Maybe you have seen Access the Gateway, the router, right? Yes.

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:51.466
And the router…

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.846
And… but I'll write…

00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:56.721
router IP addresses with 92.168.100.1, because I remember, so I'm telling you, right?

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:57.059
router IP addresses with 92.168.110.

00:14:57.494 --> 00:15:01.494
But when I say what is my IP, I go to Google, and I type what is my IP.

00:14:57.723 --> 00:15:01.723
But when I say what is my IP, I go to Google, and I type what is my IP.

00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:03.932
Right, so it gives me…

00:15:02.253 --> 00:15:04.253
Right, so it gives me…

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:06.235
an IP address for the router.

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:06.676
an IP address for the output.

00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:08.586
So, isn't that two IP addresses?

00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:08.957
So, isn't that white painters?

00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:10.678
Or the same device?

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:11.059
For the same device.

00:15:11.971 --> 00:15:25.971
I know it's… There is a public and the gateway and the… It's like, something to do with the routing? Yes. From the public to public? Because each chapter here has two IV, which is… we're gonna book…

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:18.459
I know it's different, Mr.… yeah, there is a public and, uh, like, the gateway and the…

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:28.149
It's like, uh, something to do with the routing? Yes. Because each laptop here has two iPads, which is public, which is gonna point it… If I have two… if I have…

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:27.972
If I have two… if I have…

00:15:28.357 --> 00:15:36.357
Ethernet, and vice versa. Yes, we have different IP addresses. Different or two IP addresses? Yes. For the same machine?

00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:31.605
Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Yes, we have different ideas.

00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:35.815
different or two IP addresses, two different, right? For the same machine?

00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:43.961
I'm not sure, Annie, yes, yes? Yes. Yeah.

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.674
I'm not sure, yeah, yes. Yes? Yeah.

00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:49.671
For example, if you use a VPN, you get an IP address, right? So you have more than one IP address as possible.

00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:49.997
For example, if you're using a VPN, you get an IP address. Yes. You have more than one. Yes.

00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:53.946
But anyways, you're right. So, you said, I think it can, so you're right, okay?

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.140
But anyways, you're like, so you see?

00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:54.464
I think it can show you, right?

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:56.742
Um, okay, let's move.

00:15:55.127 --> 00:15:57.127
Okay, let's move.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:02.189
Got it. Uh, so what about dynamic and the static IP addresses, right? What is the difference?

00:15:58.078 --> 00:16:02.078
Uh, so what about dynamic and static IP addresses, right? Like, what is the difference?

00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:09.938
Dynamic and aesthetic. IP addresses that get changed? Yes. But that cannot change, uh, like, uh, I mean, what is the benefit?

00:16:03.677 --> 00:16:08.677
Dynamic and strategic IP addresses that you can change? Yes. That cannot change, uh, like, uh…

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.820
I mean, what is the benefit of having an IP address that cannot change?

00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:12.514
of having IP address that cannot change.

00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:14.641
Versus the one that can crash.

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:18.379
Versus the one that can change. Yeah. For example, the server should have static.

00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:16.593
Look, some of the…

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.602
I think… Okay. Beautiful.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.090
So, when we request…

00:16:21.588 --> 00:16:26.588
any… it's so difficult to know each time what is the IV address.

00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:32.618
I need… it's so difficult to know each time what is the IP address. Dynamic, because, like, there's a million devices in the world, so it's so hard to get…

00:16:27.494 --> 00:16:34.494
Uh, dynamic, because, like, there is a million devices in the world, so it's so hard to give each device a fix.

00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:40.476
a device to fix… Just, like, if it pool is limited, and… Yes. Yeah, you cannot just reserve. Okay, I got… I understood your point when you said that, right?

00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:38.075
Like, I think pool is limited, and yeah, you cannot just use…

00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:41.175
Okay, I got… I understood your point when you said that right.

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:46.317
Maybe you use some notes, so… okay, you defined another perspective where it's fine.

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:46.499
Maybe you use some notes. You defined another perspective, but…

00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:48.174
Okay, so let's…

00:16:46.618 --> 00:16:48.618
Okay, so let's…

00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:51.664
I haven't asked this to anyone, but uh…

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.839
I haven't asked this to anyone, but uh…

00:16:52.293 --> 00:16:55.293
We use the term host for hosting, right?

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.720
We use the term most, or most, eh? Yes.

00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:59.161
And you already have told about server and client, right?

00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:59.518
And you already have told about server and client, right?

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:01.152
So…

00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:01.407
So…

00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:03.764
how, like, if I say…

00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:04.111
how, like, if I see…

00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:07.405
Post versus server versus client, like, what is host structure?

00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:07.505
Post versus server versus client? Like, what is hosting?

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:14.820
Okay, host? In terms of computer networking, right, what is a host? You already told me about the client. Okay.

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:11.967
Okay, host? Essential Computer Networking, right? What is a host?

00:17:13.172 --> 00:17:15.172
You already told me about the client. Okay.

00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:23.098
A host is like a phobi, you know? It's like the server that hosts the application. Yeah, the machine that runs the application. Yes, yes.

00:17:16.437 --> 00:17:21.437
A host is like, for me, you know, it's like the server that hosts the application.

00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:23.522
the machine that does the finish? Yes, yes.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
Yeah, good, nice.

00:17:23.512 --> 00:17:25.512
Yeah, good, nice.

00:17:25.737 --> 00:17:29.737
Okay, let's, uh, talk about… you know, I will just skip the basics now.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.870
Okay, let's, uh, talk about… you know, I will just skip the basics now.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.690
Maybe skip the basics. I will give you full score in the basics, okay? Let's move to the intermediate or advanced.

00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:36.013
Let's move to the intermediate or advanced. Okay.

00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:39.284
What is the difference between a virtual machine and a Docker container?

00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:39.615
What is the difference between a virtual machine and a Docker container?

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:46.754
Okay, virtual machine back then is consistent and locker, right? Broken container. So, specifically, I'm talking about

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.780
Okay, virtual machine-like Linux operating system.

00:17:43.774 --> 00:17:51.774
And Docker, right? Docker containers. So, specifically, I'm talking about the difference between a virtual machine and a Docker container. Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:51.699
The difference between a virtual machine and a Docker container.

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:54.653
Can you think of any difference? Yes.

00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:54.969
Can you think of any difference? Yes.

00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:57.464
Okay, so, uh,

00:17:55.686 --> 00:18:03.686
Okay, so, uh… Linux is an operating system, so it's heavy. For me, it's so heavy.

00:17:57.987 --> 00:17:59.987
Linux is an opera…

00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:09.351
So it's… it's heavy. For me, it's so heavy, and it contains… it does take a USB traffic if it is not, uh, so…

00:18:03.812 --> 00:18:11.812
And it contains… it will take a USB graphic if it is not a server, we'll take CPU and memory.

00:18:11.915 --> 00:18:16.915
Yeah. And so on. And we use it to host, for example, this app.

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:14.126
And so on. The confined?

00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:16.577
You know, we use it to post, for example, this app.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:26.130
Okay? You explained the same way. Yeah, yeah, okay. The container, both of them, for example, run in the window, okay, operating system window.

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:25.083
Okay. You explain it the same way. The container, both of them, for example, run in the window.

00:18:25.184 --> 00:18:37.184
Okay, operating system window, okay? So, at the same… that's a… I mean, CPU and ROM, that will take for the operating system, we can run so many containers, which is lightweight.

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:28.378
Okay, so at the same…

00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:31.891
That's a… I mean, CPU and ROM that…

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:36.861
take for the operating system, we can run so many containers, which is lightweight.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.770
Okay, so…

00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:40.048
Okay, so…

00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:44.425
I will ask you this. This is right, okay, so I will ask you this. So, for example, I can…

00:18:40.805 --> 00:18:44.805
I will ask you this, right? So, I will ask you this. So, for example, I could…

00:18:45.605 --> 00:18:47.605
Uh, the virtual machine.

00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:48.307
Uh, the virtual machine.

00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:52.775
So there are two things, right? Virtual machine versus a Docker container.

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:53.066
So there are two things, right? Virtual machine versus a Docker container. Yes.

00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:55.473
One of them virtualizes the hardware,

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:55.767
One of them virtualizes the hardware,

00:18:55.689 --> 00:19:00.689
And one of them virtualizes the operating system. Yeah. Which one of them?

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.937
And one of them virtualizes the…

00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:01.933
Yeah. Which one of them virtualizes the…

00:19:00.782 --> 00:19:03.782
This is the hardware. Operating system.

00:19:02.172 --> 00:19:07.172
Hardware? Operating system, Linux. Yes, like virtual machines.

00:19:04.692 --> 00:19:06.692
Yes, like virtual machines, right?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:13.260
And which one virtualizes the operating system? Uh, Docker could, uh, yes. Are you sure?

00:19:07.395 --> 00:19:12.395
And which one virtualizes the operating system? Uh, Docker, uh… Yes.

00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:17.675
Are you sure? Yes. You're right. Okay, let's go to…

00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:20.905
Yeah. Yeah, okay. You're right. Okay, let's go to… Now, again, see, this is just… hold up information here.

00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:21.421
Now, again, see, this is…

00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:23.075
So, so…

00:19:21.517 --> 00:19:23.517
So… so…

00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:26.249
I haven't asked this from anyone.

00:19:23.803 --> 00:19:26.803
I haven't asked this from anyone.

00:19:27.024 --> 00:19:31.024
Right? So, and doesn't hold any score, but it holds a bonus.

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:31.029
Right? So… and it doesn't hold any spoon, but it holds a good enough.

00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:33.028
Uh, you know what is a hypervisor?

00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:33.271
Uh, you know, what is a hypervisor?

00:19:35.477 --> 00:19:40.477
Hypervisor, yes, like a hybrids, like…

00:19:35.662 --> 00:19:38.662
Hypervisories, like the hyper…

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:42.149
You give us…

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.722
You give us, like…

00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:50.861
like, the hypervisor, it's like the application, like a virtual box, uh, and we have a Windows, like, have…

00:19:44.006 --> 00:19:54.006
The hypervisor, it's like the application, like, virtual books, and we have a Windows, like, Hyper V, I think. Yeah, yes.

00:19:50.968 --> 00:19:55.968
hyper-V, I think Hypervink. Yes, that we can't, uh…

00:19:54.358 --> 00:19:56.358
that we can, uh…

00:19:57.201 --> 00:20:08.201
run Dalytics. Like, you can create something. Yes, we have, like, Windows, then the hypervisor in the middle, then the Linux operating system. So you can create virtual machines. Yes, and with Windows.

00:19:57.628 --> 00:20:08.628
run daily Linux, like, it creates something. Yes, like, we have, like, Windows, then the hypervisor in the middle, then the Linux operating system. Yes, on top of it, Windows.

00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:13.179
Right? So, on top of that, one move, right? They are actually… we have discussed

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.650
Right? So, on top of that, one note, right? They are actually…

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.960
We have discussed Type 1 and type 2 hyperversions, right?

00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:16.802
Type 1 and type 2 hypervisors, right? Oracle Virtual…

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:19.249
Oracle Virtual Box is Type 2 or Type 1?

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.990
box is type 2 or type 1?

00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:21.458
Oracle Virtuals.

00:20:19.837 --> 00:20:21.837
Oracle Virtual Books…

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:24.199
Do you remember, don't worry about type 2, man.

00:20:22.398 --> 00:20:24.398
Do you remember, don't worry about type proven.

00:20:24.865 --> 00:20:27.865
Like, do you remember the… what was the difference between the types?

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.030
like, we remember the… what was the difference between the types?

00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:34.139
I'm not sure, but two would have the hypervisor, like virtual books, then the operating system.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.600
I'm not sure, but 2 will have the hypervisor, like virtual books, then the operating system.

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:36.496
The one…

00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:36.554
The one…

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:46.040
But you're right, for the two. Yes, because I remember this lineage. Yes, for two, you were right, Jake. Uh, let's talk about, uh, Git.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.404
I'm not sure, actually. Well, you're right.

00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:44.318
Yes, because I remember the Linux.

00:20:44.682 --> 00:20:48.682
Uh, let's talk about, uh, GitHub.

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:50.593
It was very thick. For example, when you talk about Git,

00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:51.375
For example, when you talk about Git,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.690
Uh, and let's say you are actually in a wrapbook, in which you have

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.490
Uh, and let's say you are actually

00:20:55.982 --> 00:20:57.982
Mm-hmm. In which you have…

00:20:57.653 --> 00:20:59.653
A main branch, right? Yes.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.091
I mean, brunch break. Yes.

00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:04.315
So, what is the different… like, how is the branch related to?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.670
So, what is the different… like, like, how…

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.650
is the branch related to?

00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:06.418
the commits.

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:06.859
the connects.

00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:09.613
Okay. Or, how is the branch?

00:21:07.413 --> 00:21:12.413
Okay. How is the branch? How is the commit related to the staging area?

00:21:10.194 --> 00:21:12.194
How is the commit related to the staging area?

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:14.172
And how is the branch related to that?

00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:14.551
And how is the branch related to the country?

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.830
Okay. Like, what is staging? What is a branch, and what is a committee?

00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:18.869
Okay. Like, what is the staging area? What's a brand, and what is the committee?

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:21.306
Okay. First,

00:21:19.675 --> 00:21:21.675
Okay, see. First,

00:21:22.272 --> 00:21:27.272
Uh, the file, that's not added will be in unstage area.

00:21:22.395 --> 00:21:32.395
Uh, the file, that's not added will be in unstage area. Then, when we add it, it will be in a stage area. What does staging area mean? That the

00:21:27.456 --> 00:21:30.456
Then when we added, it would be stage area. What does…

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.156
Good?

00:21:33.037 --> 00:21:44.037
The Git knows about this file now. It keeps record about it. Then after we add to the staging area will be, uh, there will be a command.

00:21:33.762 --> 00:21:35.762
knows about this quite enough.

00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:37.985
it keeps record of all.

00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:43.701
Then, after we add to the sleeping area will be, uh, there will be a comment.

00:21:44.148 --> 00:21:48.148
Commit, yes. Commit will do what? Uh, like, uh, we'll check.

00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:48.901
Uh, luck, uh, we'll take…

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:59.409
like, screenshot of the changes you have done. Like, from everywhere, or just the strategic media? The station area only, that one should be added. And then save it where? Uh…

00:21:49.805 --> 00:21:58.805
like, screenshot of the changes you have done? Like, from everywhere, or just the digital image? The station area, only the one day we added. And then symmetry?

00:21:59.254 --> 00:22:04.254
And you are, like, SSD, or in your branch, or where, like… It will be saved in the branch.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.090
Like, this is your branch, or we have, like… It will be saved in the branch.

00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:11.889
If we do logs, we have that kind of logs. We will see all the commands in this branch.

00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:09.941
We do logs, we have background logs. We'll see all the commands at this point.

00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:11.891
Okay, that's good, good.

00:22:12.453 --> 00:22:16.453
So, this was, like, basic Git, right? Uh, so…

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.560
So, this was, like, the ascent kit, right?

00:22:15.718 --> 00:22:18.718
Uh, so each branch workload, right?

00:22:16.742 --> 00:22:19.742
feature branch workload, really? I mean…

00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:20.714
I mean…

00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:24.219
You know it, so what's the benefit? Is there any benefit using a feature branch, for example?

00:22:21.622 --> 00:22:24.622
You know it, so what's the benefit? Is there any benefit using a feature project workflow?

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.469
Yes. And even benefit you with.

00:22:26.104 --> 00:22:28.104
Yes. Uh, an even benefit you get.

00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:34.586
You can think of… Future process. Workflow. Like, it…

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:34.724
you didn't think of? Future process. Like, it…

00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:46.051
What we use the first thing, because we… our team, we are working in the same, uh, project, so the feature plan should be best for us,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:45.390
why we use the first thing? Because we… our team, we are working in the same, uh, project, so the feature branch should be just

00:22:45.634 --> 00:22:47.634
For us, uh, I…

00:22:47.978 --> 00:22:50.978
the example he says that they have…

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:51.319
the example he says that it's, like, we have

00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:56.214
version 1. Okay, version 1, final.

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:56.649
version 1. Okay, version 1, final.

00:22:56.811 --> 00:23:03.811
I am version 1 really final, so we don't use this, we have a branch… And this is Git, like, say, for example, you have a branch,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:11.240
But I am version one, really final, so we don't use this, we have a branch, uh, get, like, say, for example, you have a branch, so you can keep on committing things and avoid this, right? But what is specifically the benefit of Feature Brunch workflow?

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:13.278
So you can keep on committing things, and you avoid this, right? But what is specifically the benefit of Feature Brunch workflow, where every person creates a feature branch?

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:13.699
Where every person creates a virtual product.

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:19.692
Yes. For their ticket, and then go through that room for pull request and merge, like, what is the benefit of that, actually?

00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:20.102
Yes. For the ticket, and then go through that room for $400 sandwich, like, what is the benefit of that, actually?

00:23:20.017 --> 00:23:22.017
What you are telling us the benefit of Git.

00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:23.895
What you are telling us is the benefit of Git. Okay, Git, I understand.

00:23:22.017 --> 00:23:24.017
I understand.

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:26.019
So…

00:23:24.243 --> 00:23:26.243
So…

00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:28.333
Think about it, explain, take your time.

00:23:26.723 --> 00:23:28.723
Think about it. I think you can…

00:23:28.672 --> 00:23:30.672
Take your time.

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.491
Take your time.

00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:38.917
I think I'm confused between them now.

00:23:37.969 --> 00:23:39.969
I think I'm confused between them now, but…

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.350
Well, about to go…

00:23:41.224 --> 00:23:55.224
But the thing you are, uh… the feature branch, like, we have… from this, we will take another branch here, then someone else will take a branch, then all of us will merge it to the main. This is the feature punch, right, basically? Yes.

00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:56.765
The thing you are, uh… the future branch, like, we have… from this, we will take another branch here, then someone else will take a branch, then all of us will merge it to the meeting. This is the feature punch, right? Yes. So what is the benefit you see here?

00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:57.217
So, this is the management you see.

00:23:58.826 --> 00:24:06.826
For the team members. So, together, at the same time, like, I'm not waiting for him to merge to, I mean, to submit the file, then I work to…

00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:13.336
We can work together at the same time, like, I'm not waiting for him to merge them to, I mean, to submit the file, then I worked in the files. So, uh, what you mean is you can work in isolation, right? Yes, and… Can you… can you back up

00:24:08.076 --> 00:24:13.076
So, uh, what you mean is you can work in isolation, right? Yes, and… Can you, can you back up…

00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:15.909
you're… sometimes when you try to push,

00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:16.957
your… because sometimes when you try to push… Yes.

00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:19.179
Uh, if someone already has…

00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:19.485
Uh, if someone already has push, right? Mm-hmm.

00:24:19.428 --> 00:24:23.428
So, Git will not let you push the data pool, right? Yes.

00:24:19.614 --> 00:24:23.614
So, Git will not let you push the new record, right? Yes.

00:24:23.953 --> 00:24:26.953
can this happen if you are working using a feature branch?

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:27.547
Can this happen? If you are working using a feature branch?

00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:38.175
Can't have been Busyana will not affect me if someone push OK, and I'm still working here, I can go back to the main bull?

00:24:29.265 --> 00:24:38.265
It can happen, Busiano will not affect me, and if someone push OK, and I am still working here, I can go back to the main bolt,

00:24:38.373 --> 00:24:42.373
Okay, I think I didn't explain the solution or anything properly, right? Yeah.

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:44.476
Oh, okay. So maybe I didn't explain the question, I think, properly, right? So, for example, you're working on this branch, right? Yes.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.940
For example, you are working on this branch, right? Yes. If someone makes a change here in the main branch, right?

00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:49.191
If someone makes a change here in the main branch, right, would it let you not…

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.990
wouldn't let you not…

00:24:49.722 --> 00:24:51.722
Push and pull from your branch.

00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:52.091
push and pull from your branch.

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:58.424
Would something go wrong when pulling and pushing from your organization? If someone actually pushes something from the main branch, really?

00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:58.731
Would something go wrong when pulling and pushing from your branch? If someone actually pushes something to the main branch, right?

00:24:58.537 --> 00:25:00.537
No. No, I should.

00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.789
No? Are you sure?

00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:02.931
Yes. Okay, that's good.

00:25:01.135 --> 00:25:03.135
Yes. Okay, yes.

00:25:03.792 --> 00:25:05.792
Yeah, good, it's good.

00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:06.261
Yeah, good.

00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:11.669
Okay, let's talk about deployment, right? But before deployment, let's talk about Doppler.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.120
Okay, let's talk about deployment, uh, deployment, right? But before deployment, let's talk about the upgrade.

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:14.269
Yes. Docker…

00:25:12.556 --> 00:25:14.556
Yes, of course. Dr.

00:25:14.257 --> 00:25:19.257
file versus Docker image versus Docker container, like, how do they relate? Okay.

00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:19.778
file versus Docker image versus Docker Container. Like, how do they delay it? Okay.

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:22.651
So, first, create the Dockerfile,

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:23.074
So, first, we'll create the Dockerfile.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.110
Uh…

00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:25.458
Uh…

00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:28.791
that will have, for example, uh, build…

00:25:26.257 --> 00:25:31.257
that will have, for example, uh, built from this folder, or this…

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.910
From this…

00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:33.961
uh… file, uh…

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.780
file, uh, then if we want the name,

00:25:34.398 --> 00:25:40.398
We want… uh… yeah, let's say… let's say you have a Dockerfile. Yes.

00:25:36.738 --> 00:25:43.738
Let's say you have a Docker file. Yes. What can you do with the Docker file? The Dockerfile will…

00:25:40.574 --> 00:25:43.574
What can you do with the document? The Docker file?

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:53.296
Uh, we will… Help you do work. …build the image. Okay, from the image, we have, like, the… all the files

00:25:44.316 --> 00:25:46.316
Help you do what?

00:25:46.382 --> 00:25:51.382
built the image. Built the image, okay. Okay. From the image, we have, like,

00:25:51.927 --> 00:25:56.927
All the fuzz from the Python, but still not trying to run, and…

00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:57.428
from the Python, but still not running. To run, and…

00:25:57.866 --> 00:26:03.866
make it as of an application that anyone can access it. We have to run it as a container after the run?

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:03.989
make it as an application that anyone can access it. We have to run it as a container after the run.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:15.197
It would be as a… Okay, so… image, then container. Can you have more than one container based on the same image? Yes, of course, we have, uh, the version and the latest.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:15.470
It would be as a complete… Okay, so… While image, then container. Can you have more than one container based on the same image? Yes, of course, we have, uh, the version and the latest.

00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:21.884
No, no, not images. Can you have more than one container based on the same… like, for example, when you do docker run,

00:26:16.157 --> 00:26:22.157
No, no, not images. If you have more than one container, please run the seamless. Like, for example, when you do docker run,

00:26:21.948 --> 00:26:23.948
So you specify the name of the image, right? Yes.

00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:24.283
So you specify the name of the imagery? Yes.

00:26:24.492 --> 00:26:27.492
If I run the same command again, but use different ports,

00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:27.908
If I run the same command again, but use different probes…

00:26:27.571 --> 00:26:30.571
So, can it run the attainer again?

00:26:27.956 --> 00:26:30.956
So, connect from the container again?

00:26:31.043 --> 00:26:33.043
While the old container is already running.

00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:33.371
While the old container is already running?

00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:35.708
Yes? Again? It's count.

00:26:34.103 --> 00:26:36.103
Yes? Come, yeah.

00:26:36.584 --> 00:26:39.584
Okay, so, uh, let's talk about Docker Compose, then.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:42.730
Okay, so, uh, let's talk about Docker Compose then. What is the benefit of Docker Complete, then, if you can just, uh…

00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:42.371
What is the benefit of Docker Compose, then, if you can just, uh…

00:26:43.095 --> 00:26:48.095
Okay, it's fine. So let's talk about Docker Compose. What is the benefit you see of Docker VMOS?

00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:48.192
Okay, fine. So let's talk about Docker Comes. What is the benefit you see of brokers?

00:26:49.077 --> 00:26:54.077
Docker Compose that have multiple images that can run?

00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:54.256
Ducker composed that have multiple images that can run.

00:26:54.955 --> 00:27:01.955
one command, joker up. We can't… maybe this image can relate… it may relate it to each other, and I want to…

00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:59.229
one command, look it up. You can't… maybe this image can relate, uh…

00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:09.135
It may… related to each other, and I want to, for example, to run the backend, then the… for example, the database, the backend, then the front end, so…

00:27:02.735 --> 00:27:08.735
to run the backend, for example, the database, the backend, then the front end, so…

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.930
goes… So, you mean, like, related containers, right? Yes. Like, related containers, okay? Yes.

it goes… So, you mean, like, related containers? Yes. Like, related containers? Yes.

00:27:14.218 --> 00:27:17.218
Uh, can you run related containers without Docker Compose?

00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:17.533
Uh, can you run related containers without bugs?

00:27:18.423 --> 00:27:23.423
Like, I've just opened command prompt separately, and can you run it without Docker Compose?

00:27:18.624 --> 00:27:23.624
Yes. Like, just token command prompt separately, and can you run it without Docker Compose?

00:27:23.864 --> 00:27:32.864
Yes, we can. And what is the benefit that you see using a Docker Compose, then? It's easier, Mr. Luck. For example, I'm running… No, it's fine, I got the answer.

00:27:24.286 --> 00:27:33.286
Yes, we can, but… What is the benefit that you see using the document? It's easier, mister. Like, for example, I'm running each… each one.

00:27:32.947 --> 00:27:37.947
And it's good. Time is short today. Yeah, but your answer is right.

Uh, yeah, you know what, uh…

00:27:44.057 --> 00:27:49.057
pull request, right? So, what is this squash merge? And I haven't asked this question to anyone, from anywhere.

00:27:44.471 --> 00:27:49.471
a pull request, right? So, what is a splash merge? And I haven't asked this question to anyone from anywhere.

00:27:49.932 --> 00:27:53.932
This is a bonus one. Such more scotch.

00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:53.357
This is a bonus win. Much, much.

00:27:54.332 --> 00:27:59.332
What does this questionnaire do? Do you remember? Why do we do splash merge? When we click that green button?

00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:56.429
What does this questionnaire do, you know?

00:27:56.455 --> 00:27:58.455
Do you remember? Basically, we do squash merch.
